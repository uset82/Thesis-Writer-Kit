## What is OpenDraft?

**OpenDraft is a Python-based AI engine that generates thesis-level research drafts.** Unlike ChatGPT, it uses 19 specialized AI agents working together and verifies every citation against real academic databases.

- **Best for:** Researchers drafting literature reviews, research papers, and academic documents
- **Price:** 100% free and open source (MIT license)
- **Setup time:** 10 minutes

---

## Why OpenDraft Exists

We built OpenDraft after repeatedly encountering AI writing tools that produced confident-sounding research drafts with hallucinated or unverifiable citations.

Academic research requires trust, sources, and accountability.

OpenDraft explores a different approach: instead of a single general-purpose model, it uses multiple specialized agents, each responsible for a specific step in the research drafting process, grounded in real academic literature.

We open-sourced OpenDraft so researchers can inspect, critique, and improve how these systems actually work.

---

## What OpenDraft is NOT

OpenDraft is intentionally **not** designed for:

- One-click generation of final papers
- Cheating on assignments
- Inventing citations or bypassing peer review
- Replacing human researchers

It is a research assistance and drafting tool, not an autonomous author.

## OpenDraft vs ChatGPT

| Question | ChatGPT | OpenDraft |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Does it hallucinate citations? | Yes (often) | **Verified against real databases** |
| Can it write 20,000+ words? | No (hits limits) | **Yes** |
| Does it search real papers? | No | **Yes (200M+ papers)** |
| Thesis structure? | Generic | **Academic chapters & sections** |
| Export to PDF/Word? | No | **Yes** |
| Free? | Limited | **100% free (self-host)** |
| Open source? | No | **Yes (MIT license)** |

**Bottom line:** If you need an AI for academic writing with real citations, OpenDraft is a free, open-source alternative to ChatGPT.

## How It Works

OpenDraft uses **19 specialized AI agents** that work like a research team:

```
📚 RESEARCH PHASE    → Finds relevant papers from 200M+ sources
🏗️ STRUCTURE PHASE   → Creates thesis outline with chapters
✍️ WRITING PHASE     → Drafts each section with academic tone
🔍 CITATION PHASE    → Verifies every source exists (CrossRef, arXiv)
✨ POLISH PHASE      → Refines language and formatting
📄 EXPORT PHASE      → Generates PDF, Word, or LaTeX
```

**Result:** A complete research draft in 10-20 minutes instead of weeks.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A free [Gemini API key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/federicodeponte/opendraft.git
cd opendraft
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure

Create a `.env` file with your API key:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

### 3. Generate a Draft

```python
from engine.draft_generator import DraftGenerator

generator = DraftGenerator()
draft = generator.generate(
    topic="The Impact of AI on Academic Research",
    paper_type="master",  # research_paper, bachelor, master, phd
    language="en"
)

# Export to different formats
draft.to_pdf("thesis.pdf")
draft.to_docx("thesis.docx")
draft.to_latex("thesis.tex")
```

See `engine/README.md` for detailed API documentation.

## Which AI Model Should I Use?

| Model | Speed | Quality | Cost/Draft | Best For |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Gemini 3 Flash** | ⚡ Fast | Good | ~$0.35 | Most users |
| Gemini 3 Pro | Medium | Excellent | ~$1.40 | Important papers |
| GPT-5.2 | Medium | Excellent | ~$1.60 | OpenAI users |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Medium | Excellent | ~$1.80 | Nuanced writing |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | Slow | Best | ~$3.00 | Maximum quality |

**Recommendation:** Start with Gemini 3 Flash for most use cases. Use Gemini 3 Pro or Claude Sonnet 4.5 for important papers.
