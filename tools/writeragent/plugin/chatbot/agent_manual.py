"""Topic-based delivery of the shared behavioral pieces (MCP / external-agent channel).

The SOURCE OF TRUTH for the cross-cutting behavioral rules lives in plugin/framework/constants.py:
the original chat system prompt pieces (TOOL_USAGE_PATTERNS, WRITER_APPLY_DOCUMENT_HTML_RULES,
TRANSLATION_RULES), updated in place and extended with new pieces (WRITER_REVIEW_MODES_RULES,
WRITER_SEARCH_RULES, WRITER_NAVIGATION_RULES, WRITER_IMAGES_RULES). The sidebar system prompt
template assembles those pieces directly, adding its sidebar-only parts (persona, chat format,
delegation routing, memory).

This module is the on-demand assembly of the same pieces: get_guidance(topic) serves ONE topic at
a time, mapping topic -> piece per document type and adding the MCP-only extras (the HTTP 429
concurrency contract, which the in-process sidebar never needs). Its consumers:
- external MCP clients (they drop/truncate connect-time instructions, so pull is their ONLY
  channel, plus JIT state in tool results);
- the sidebar agent, for the reference pieces (search/navigation/images) its HYBRID prompt keeps
  out of the ambient text — get_guidance is tier "core" so the sidebar can call it;
- the agent-backend path (send_handlers), which injects full_manual() — it talks to the HTTP
  server, so it takes the whole manual including the MCP extras.

Same pieces, different assembly per channel — update a rule in constants.py and every consumer
sees it; only genuinely channel-specific text lives outside the shared pieces.

Sections are per document type: Writer has the full manual; Calc and Draw currently get the generic
sections (tools-not-chat, confirmation by structured fields, concurrency) until app-specific prose is
written. ``get_guidance`` resolves the target document's type the same way every other tool does, so
a Calc session never reads Writer advice."""
