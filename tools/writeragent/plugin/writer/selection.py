"""set_selection — select a passage so the user sees it highlighted and target='selection' can
act on it. Headless MCP clients have no way to set a selection otherwise, which made
target='selection' a trap (see the target_resolver fix). Selection is view state and transient,
so for headless flows set_selection and the follow-up edit should be consecutive."""
