"""Word-level diff splitter for Track-Changes redlines.

PROBLEM
-------
With Track Changes ON, an agent edit today replaces the whole old block with the
whole new block: one Delete + one Insert (see ``plugin/writer/format.py`` recording
branch). For a tiny tweak ("teh" -> "the") in a long paragraph that buries the real
change under a wall of struck-through/inserted text the user cannot meaningfully
review. There is an *existing* char-by-char diff in ``replace_preserving_format`` but
it is DISABLED while recording because per-character redlines render as scrambled,
interleaved garbage.

This module is the PURE-PYTHON, LibreOffice-INDEPENDENT core of the fix. It does NOT
touch UNO/LO. It decides, for a given ``(old, new)`` pair, whether the edit should be:

  * a single whole-block replacement (the change is "big" -- > ``threshold`` of the
    words changed), matching today's behaviour; OR
  * a list of small, surgical sub-edits, each one a contiguous run of WORDS to be
    replaced / inserted / deleted, with CONSECUTIVE changed words AGGLUTINATED into a
    single sub-edit.

Each surgical sub-edit carries char offsets into ``old`` plus the exact old/new spans,
so a later (separate) step in ``format.py`` can turn each sub-edit into its OWN tracked
Delete+Insert by selecting the sub-range ``old[old_start:old_end]`` of the target range.

TOKENISATION
------------
The string is split into an alternating sequence of *word* and *separator* tokens that
together reconstruct the original string EXACTLY (concatenation is lossless). A "word"
is a maximal run of non-whitespace; a "separator" is a maximal run of whitespace.
Punctuation stays attached to the word run it touches (we do not split on punctuation),
which keeps the token count -- and therefore the change fraction -- intuitive and keeps
offsets exact. Only WORD tokens participate in the diff; the separators between matched
words are preserved verbatim and the separators around a changed run are absorbed into
that run's spans so reconstruction is exact.

CHANGE FRACTION (precise definition)
------------------------------------
We run ``difflib.SequenceMatcher`` over the WORD-token sequences of old and new. From
its opcodes we count:

  * ``changed_words`` = (# old words in 'replace'/'delete' blocks)
                      + (# new words in 'replace'/'insert' blocks)
  * ``total_words``   = (# old words in 'equal' blocks)  -- i.e. unchanged words
                      + ``changed_words``

so ``total_words`` counts each unchanged word once and each changed word once on
whichever side(s) it appears. The fraction is::

    fraction_changed = changed_words / total_words      (0.0 if total_words == 0)

BOUNDARY SEMANTICS
------------------
``fraction_changed > threshold``  -> WHOLE-BLOCK replacement.
``fraction_changed <= threshold`` -> SURGICAL sub-edits.

So the threshold is the *inclusive upper bound* for staying surgical: a fraction
EXACTLY at the threshold (e.g. exactly 0.60 with the default) stays SURGICAL. Only a
fraction strictly ABOVE the threshold flips to a whole-block replacement. Rationale:
"60% or less changed" is still worth surgically redlining; only past 60% is it noisy
enough to be a single clean block edit.

Two trivial fast-paths: identical strings -> surgical mode with zero sub-edits;
``total_words == 0`` (both blank) -> surgical mode with zero sub-edits.
