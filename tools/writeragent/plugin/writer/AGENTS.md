# Writer

Root invariants still apply (tool `uno_services` first, `guard_uno` at
document boundaries, LibrePy-safe helpers in `plugin/doc/text_helpers.py`).

## Entry points

- HTML import / apply-content (callers `import format as format_support`): `format.py`
- Charts / shapes (shared **names** with Calc/Draw): `specialized/charts.py`, `specialized/shapes.py`
- Light reads (tracked deletions, heading tree, selection text/range, text slices): `plugin/doc/text_helpers.py`
- Streamed Writer rewrite/append + compound undo: `plugin/writer/edit_review.py`

## Sharp edges

- Writer `charts` / `shapes` share tool **names** with Calc/Draw — the Writer class must declare the **union** of those UNO services or execution rejects the document.
- Extend / Edit selection prompts must use `get_string_without_tracked_deletions()` in `text_helpers`, not a raw text dump that includes tracked deletions.
- Do not import `document_helpers` from LibrePy paths (WriterAgent chat context / `DocumentService`). Light helpers stay in `text_helpers` / `doc_type` / `udprops` and are **not** re-exported from `document_helpers`.
