"""Inline review of tracked changes.

Accept or reject the tracked change the cursor sits on as ONE unit. A text replace records two
redlines -- a Delete (struck old text) and an Insert (new text) -- which must be resolved
together (accepting one and rejecting the other yields an incoherent result).

We select the change's EXACT bounds (both marks of its pair) and drive the native
``.uno:AcceptTrackedChange`` / ``.uno:RejectTrackedChange`` on that range. On modern LibreOffice
(>=25.04 / 26.x) this resolves ONLY the targeted change, so a paragraph may hold several agent
changes that are each accepted/rejected individually. On older builds where an exact-bounds
dispatch is a no-op, we fall back to a paragraph-wide selection (which resolves everything in
range, so it refuses when another tracked change shares the paragraph).

Selecting a RANGE rather than a single redline's anchor is deliberate: a pure Delete redline has
an empty anchor, so the per-redline ``select(anchor)`` path in ``tracking.py`` cannot target it;
a range selection covers both marks of the pair. The user's own tracked changes are never touched.

This is the model layer; the right-click context menu in ``change_context_menu.py`` calls it.
