"""Edit review session: agent edits land as reviewable tracked changes, and the agent
learns the per-change outcome.

One module owns the whole review story (recording state, author scoping, change tagging,
anchoring, outcome detection, wait-for-review, cleanup), so entry points don't sprinkle
``RecordChanges`` / author toggles around::

    with EditReviewSession(doc, ctx, enabled=flag) as session:
        session.record_mutation(apply_fn)      # one call per logical change
    outcomes = session.wait_for_review(timeout=600)   # polls on the caller's thread

How a change is tracked end to end:

* ``record_mutation`` snapshots the document's redline identifiers, runs the edit, and tags
  every NEW redline's ``RedlineComment`` with a per-change token (``wa-review:<session>:<n>``).
  Completion is "no redline carrying this session's token remains" -- NOT "zero redlines in
  the document" -- so the user's own pre-existing redlines never block or confuse it.
* Each change is anchored with a bookmark (``wa_review_<session>_<n>``) spanning the affected
  range, so it survives positions shifting as other changes are resolved. Bookmarks are
  always removed when the review finishes (success, timeout, or error).
* Outcome detection must survive the redline disappearing on BOTH accept and reject, and the
  user editing the text during review. At record time we derive, from the tracked state, the
  paragraph text as it would read after an accept (skip tracked deletions) and after a reject
  (skip tracked insertions). At review end the anchored paragraph is compared against both:
  equal to the accept form -> ``accepted``; the reject form -> ``rejected``; anything else ->
  ``modified`` (the agent must not assume either text survived).

The session is inert when ``enabled`` is False (edits apply directly, ``wait_for_review``
returns an empty complete result), and degrades to inert if tracking cannot be enabled.
