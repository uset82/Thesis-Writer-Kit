"""Split authoring for agent tracked changes: insertions and deletions get DIFFERENT authors
so LibreOffice's "show changes by author" coloring shows them in two distinct colors.

A redline's author is captured at creation time and is READ-ONLY afterward (setting
RedlineAuthor on an existing redline is a silent no-op), so the only way to author a replace's
Insert and Delete differently is to swap the office author BETWEEN the deletion and the
insertion. EditReviewSession makes the INSERT author the default for the whole edit via
``begin()``; each replace primitive wraps its ``setString("")`` deletion in ``deletion_author()``,
which flips the office author to the DELETE author for that moment and back. All of this runs
synchronously on the main thread, so the brief intermediate author state is never observed.

The actual colors are LibreOffice's automatic per-author choice (we cannot pick them) -- the two
authors just guarantee two distinct colors. Inert (no swaps) unless ``begin()`` armed this thread.
