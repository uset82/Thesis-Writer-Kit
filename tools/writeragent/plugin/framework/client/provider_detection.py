Centralized provider and endpoint detection heuristics.

This module is the single source of truth (as of the 2026 framework janitor
effort) for answering questions like:

- "Which provider does this endpoint URL belong to?"
- "Is this a local / LAN host where self-signed certs are common?"
- "Should we treat this as OpenRouter even if the hostname is a custom proxy?"

### Why this module exists (the problem it solves)

Before consolidation the same (or very similar) string matching logic was
scattered across at least these locations:

- plugin/framework/client/model_fetcher.py          (imports get_provider_from_endpoint)
- plugin/framework/client/auth.py                    (_resolve_provider_id + host_matches)
- plugin/framework/client/llm_client.py              (is_openrouter_endpoint)
- plugin/framework/client/requests.py / request_controls.py (is_local_host)
- plugin/framework/client/errors.py (historical)     (connection refused / DNS strings in the mapper)
- plugin/framework/config.py                         (is_openrouter + openwebui string checks)
- plugin/framework/url_utils.py                      (z.ai / openwebui special cases)

This made it easy for the list of known providers (Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter,
Groq, Cerebras, Z.ai, etc.) to get out of sync, and for local-host heuristics to
drift between the SSL fallback path and the friendly error messages.

### Design principles for this module (first pass)

- Pure functions only — no I/O, no config side effects.
- Keep the nice data-driven table in auth.py (PROVIDERS + host_matches) as the
  authority for *authentication behavior*. Detection feeds it, it does not replace it.
- First-pass scope: the highest-ROI, lowest-risk functions only
  (get_provider_from_endpoint, is_local_host, is_openrouter_endpoint).
- Audio capability heuristics, full preset lists, and shim selection stay in
  their original homes for now (they can be pulled in later passes).
- All existing callers continue to get identical results.

New providers or detection rules should be added in one place and will
automatically benefit error messages, auth, model fetching, local SSL handling,
and logging.
