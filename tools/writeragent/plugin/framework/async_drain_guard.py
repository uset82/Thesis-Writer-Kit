"""Main-Thread Async Event Loop Sentry.

Enforces single-ownership of main-thread UI event pumping to prevent
harmful nested event-loop reentrancy (e.g. recursive processEventsToIdle calls).

Concurrency: LibreOffice’s UI toolkit (VCL) misbehaves if two Python
loops call ``processEventsToIdle`` at once (nested dialogs, recursive
pumps, frozen window). ``_drain_lock`` records **which drain loop
currently owns that pump**, not a lock for all UI code. A second owner
trying to nest raises; the same owner re-entering is counted so it can
unwind. Do not hold this lock while talking to the document or the
network — acquire, note ownership, release, then pump.
