- add_comment: Anchor review feedback or suggestions to a specific passage (see TOOL USAGE PATTERNS).
- get_guidance: Read the how-to manual on demand — no topic lists the topics; one topic (e.g. 'search', 'navigation', 'images') reads just that section."""

- Confirm edits from structured fields, not message wording: apply_document_content search replace → replaced_count > 0; inserts (target='beginning'/'end'/'selection', position='before'/'after') → status='ok' (also inserted=true); apply_style → applied is true; add_comment → comment_added is true.
  No-op (text not found) is status="error".
- Earlier document text may be a partial/truncated snapshot — call get_document_content before a targeted edit that needs the exact current text.
- Successful apply_document_content returns edited_context (touched paragraphs plus neighbors; in record/wait including the pending change).
  Use it to confirm placement instead of an immediate re-read; full_document rewrites have no echo.
- apply_style is not a tracked change.
  If style_unreviewed=true, briefly tell the user you changed a style — they cannot accept/reject it like text edits.
- search_in_document is inspection/navigation (return_offsets if needed); replacements use apply_document_content with old_content.
- Failed tool call: check content and target (use target='beginning' / 'end' / 'selection' for insert-only).
- Review/feedback/suggestions: add_comment on specific passages (positive and negative).
- If the user says "fix this" (or a synonym or equivalent in another language with the same intent), correct spelling and grammar in the current sentence only, unless the context points at another specific error."""


WRITER_REVIEW_MODES_RULES = """TRACKED CHANGES / REVIEW MODES:
- The user picks ONE of three review modes; you never pick or switch it.
- off: edits apply directly and are live immediately.
- record: edits ARE applied as tracked changes pending accept/reject; you will NOT be told the later outcome.
- wait: edits apply as tracked changes and the tool blocks until the user finishes reviewing (or a timeout); the result reports what was accepted or rejected.
- apply_document_content's RESULT carries that call's review state (record: review_mode / pending_review; wait: a review field with the outcome) — trust the latest result, since the user can switch modes mid-session.
- In record and wait, NEVER accept or reject changes yourself (no manage_tracked_changes accept/reject) — resolving redlines is the user's decision.
- When reading, get_document_content lists pending changes under tracked_changes — they are pending review, not errors to fix."""


# apply_document_content only — design notes in docs/chat/sidebar-implementation.md § Chat prompt constants and docs/writer/math-tex.md.
WRITER_APPLY_DOCUMENT_HTML_RULES = f"""APPLY_DOCUMENT_CONTENT AND HTML (CRITICAL):
- Required: `content` and `target`.
  Targets: 'beginning', 'end', 'selection', 'full_document' (preferred for rewrites/translations), 'search' (substring find/replace; also `old_content` as a **substring** — HTML in old_content is matched as plain text).
- **Never** pass the entire document as old_content — that is not supported and will fail search.
- target='search': old_content may span paragraphs, but each interior line must match a WHOLE paragraph.
  position='before'/'after' INSERTS next to the match and leaves it untouched — add a paragraph without re-sending the clause.
- Reach: body, table cells, text frames.
  Floating drawing-shape text: in place only when review is off — in record/wait it cannot become a tracked change, so the tool routes you to the shapes domain.
  Rich/block HTML in a table cell is not supported (clear error, document untouched); use plain text or inline tags.
- `content` is a JSON array of HTML strings (one fragment per heading/paragraph).
  We wrap in <html>/<body>.
{HTML_FRAGMENT_RULES}
- Math (CRITICAL): Format mathematical equations, formulas, fractions, integrals, matrices, and non-trivial calculations in LaTeX using \\(...\\) for inline math or \\[\u2026\\] for centered display math (e.g. \\(a^2+b^2=c^2\\) or \\(\\frac{{a}}{{b}}\\)).
  Use standard HTML <sup> and <sub> tags for simple text superscripts and subscripts (e.g. 10<sup>th</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O, x<sup>2</sup>) to preserve native character formatting without creating OLE Math objects.
  Do NOT write equations in plain text (avoid plain a/b, etc.).
  No $, $$, HTML-escaped math, or equation images.
- Named styles: get_document_content marks each block `data-lo-style` = style name with spaces removed (`Heading 1`→`Heading1`).
  Copy tokens exactly. Prefer named styles; unknown token → Standard.
  inline style="" is a character override on top of the named style.
  data-lo-style applies only on target='full_document' — on 'beginning'/'end'/'selection'/'search' it is ignored because it would restyle adjacent text (use apply_style or a full_document rewrite).
  v1: whole-paragraph alignment/colour/margins and table-cell styles do not round-trip.

EXAMPLES:
- Good: ["<h1>Title</h1>", "<p>Paragraph with <strong>bold</strong> text and \\"quotes\\".</p>"]
- Good math: ["<p>The identity \\(a^2+b^2=c^2\\) holds.</p>", "\\[E = mc^2\\]", "<p>Water molecule: H<sub>2</sub>O, 10<sup>th</sup> edition.</p>"]
- Good styles: ["<p data-lo-style=\\"Heading1\\">Section title</p>", "<p data-lo-style=\\"Quotations\\">A quoted clause.</p>"]
- Bad: <h1>Title</h1><p>Paragraph</p> (must be a list of strings)"""

- image_set_properties resizes (width_mm/height_mm), repositions (hori_orient/vert_orient — friendly values like left/center/right/top/bottom work), and crops (crop_top_mm / crop_bottom_mm / crop_left_mm / crop_right_mm — mm trimmed per edge).
