"""Service infrastructure: base class and registry.

Concurrency: ``ServiceRegistry`` (``services.document``, ``services.events``,
…) is populated while the extension bootstraps on the UI thread, then
read for the rest of the session. There is no lock. Do not call
``register`` from a background worker — you can race the dict and you
will confuse shutdown order.
