"""Undo/redo tools for all document types via XUndoManager.

Re-enabled (was ToolBaseDummy): with review mode off an agent's bad edit was unrecoverable
except by the user's own Ctrl+Z — the agent had no rollback at all. The undo stack is SHARED
with the user's manual edits, so the descriptions steer the model to undo only its own last
action and to tell the user."""
