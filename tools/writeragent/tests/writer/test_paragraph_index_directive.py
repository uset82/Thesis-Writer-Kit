"""Coverage test for the 'never cite paragraph numbers' directive (#1 / E4).

Every model-facing tool that returns a para_index / paragraph_index to the model must tell it not to
cite that number to the user (the index is internal and shifts as the document changes). This pins
that coverage so a future tool can't quietly start leaking an index without the directive.
