"""Headless tests for the surgical tracked-change offset safety net.

The surgical path in ``record_preserve_replace`` places each sub-edit by counting characters
(``_go_right``) from the block start, then replaces. If the cursor ever lands short (goRight stops
early), the edit would hit the WRONG characters and silently corrupt the document. These tests pin,
WITHOUT a live LibreOffice (a fake UNO text/cursor), that:

  * ``_go_right`` reports whether the FULL move happened (True) or it stopped short (False),
  * a sub-edit whose offset can't be reached aborts surgical and falls back to ONE whole-block
    replace (never a misplaced edit),
  * the happy path records exactly the surgical sub-edits, and
  * an offset that drifts AFTER the pre-flight validation fails LOUD (raises) instead of corrupting.

The real splitter (``word_diff_split.split_change``) is used for real; only UNO is faked.
