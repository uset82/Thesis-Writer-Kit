By utilizing frameworks like G-Eval and Prometheus, we've moved beyond simple string matching to a nuanced analysis of semantic correctness, formatting fidelity, and naturalness. Furthermore, version 2.0 includes a new 'Dual-Mode' evaluation system that intelligently distinguishes between structural tasks like table generation and creative tasks like logical rewriting, applying weighted criteria specifically tailored to each task type. We've also optimized our OpenRouter integration to support the latest model releases, including the Qwen 3.5 and Gemini 3 Flash series.
