"""Resilient stdio<->HTTP MCP bridge for WriterAgent (R7 — plug-and-play connect).

WHY: WriterAgent's MCP server is an HTTP server that lives INSIDE LibreOffice
(http://localhost:18765/mcp). An MCP client configured to talk to that URL directly
(``{"type":"http","url":"..."}``) tries to connect once at startup; if LibreOffice
is not running yet, the connection fails and the user must restart the client to
reconnect ("I have to close and reopen to connect").

A stdio MCP server, by contrast, is *spawned by the client* — so it is always present
the moment the client starts. This bridge is that stdio server: the client launches it,
and it forwards every request to LibreOffice over HTTP, **waiting/retrying when
LibreOffice is not up yet**. So it no longer matters who starts first — the connection
establishes on its own, with no restart. Configure it once (no per-use fiddling):

    "writer-agent": { "command": "python3", "args": ["/abs/path/scripts/mcp_bridge.py"] }

Override the target with WRITERAGENT_MCP_URL. Pure stdlib so the client's Python can run it.

    WHAT WAS WRONG: on Windows sys.stdin/sys.stdout/sys.stderr default to the ANSI codepage
    (cp1252 in most locales), not UTF-8.

    HOW IT HAPPENED: MCP clients speak UTF-8 JSON over the pipe, so every
    multi-byte character was decoded a byte at a time with the wrong codec --
    U+00ED (bytes C3 AD) surfaced as two cp1252 characters, an em dash
    (E2 80 94) as three. The text was already corrupted here, before the request
    reached the HTTP layer, which decodes UTF-8 explicitly and is correct. That
    is why the same server returns clean text over direct HTTP and mangled text
    through this bridge -- the stdio hop was the only ambiguous one.

    WHY THIS FIXES IT: pinning all three streams to UTF-8 makes this hop match
    what the client sends and what the HTTP layer already expects. stdin/stdout
    use surrogateescape so a malformed byte does not raise UnicodeDecodeError
    inside ``for line in sys.stdin`` (which would kill the bridge); the existing
    JSONDecodeError handler then skips that line. stderr uses backslashreplace,
    matching Python's UTF-8 mode, so a later traceback stays readable. getattr
    guards the call because tests (and any caller) may substitute a plain
    StringIO, which has no reconfigure().
