# Collabora Online and jail-safe execution

> **Status: Step A (compute service) + Step B (kit/wsd wire) + Step C (Core Calc AddIn) landed.** Correctness/lifecycle/platform blockers from the 2026-07 review are addressed in tree. **G6a (active pending timeout)** and **G6c (weak AddIn.idl identity cache)** are done. The uncommitted 2026-07-23 C++ cleanup in the current working tree adds emitter re-entrancy/ABI fixes, corrupt-frame replies, Unicode-surrogate and rectangular-grid hardening, reviewer hygiene, and **F1 UnitWSD enable/disable + POST/result CI**. Core CppUnit, UnitWSD, `coolwsd`, and both forkit variants pass locally. Still open before Gerrit: request/in-flight caps, the remaining service-isolation work, and commit-series preparation — see [Still open before Gerrit](#still-open-before-gerrit). Product follow-ups (not coded): **visible short Python errors ([F6](#f6--visible-short-python-errors))** and **single-cell auto-spill ([F7](#f7--single-cell-auto-spill))**. Classic remains the warm-venv path. ER: [CollaboraOnline/online#16010](https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/issues/16010).

## Why the desktop design cannot enter the kit jail

The NumPy strategy ([§1](../enabling_numpy_in_libreoffice.md#1-the-problem-abi-and-embedded-python), [§2](../enabling_numpy_in_libreoffice.md#2-strategy-decision)) is deliberately a **separate interpreter**:

1. `subprocess.Popen` **of a user venv** — `[PythonWorkerManager](../../plugin/scripting/venv_worker.py)` keeps a warm child talking Pickle5 over pipes ([IPC](numpy-serialization.md#worker-protocol)).
2. **Host filesystem** — resolve `scripting.python_venv_path`, put the extension tree on the child’s `sys.path`, and let trusted helpers open DBs/models.
3. **Flatpak escape** — `[wrap_command_for_sandbox](../../plugin/scripting/sandbox.py)` can use `flatpak-spawn --host` so the venv runs on the real host. That is the opposite of kit isolation.
4. **Desktop editor** — Monaco via **pywebview/Qt** needs a display and a child window; Online renders in a browser canvas.
5. **Long-lived shared kernel** — optional workbook namespace inside the warm process assumes a desktop process lifecycle, not an ephemeral per-document kit.

Collabora Online’s document work runs in a **jailed** `coolkit` **/ LOKit** child. That jail is not allowed to call arbitrary external programs, use the shell, or reach the wider filesystem. The warm-venv path depends on exactly those privileges.

**Hardening the AST sandbox inside the jail does not fix this.** The sandbox in `[venv_sandbox.py](../../plugin/scripting/venv/venv_sandbox.py)` is defense-in-depth for untrusted script *strings*; Online needs **OS-level isolation**, and the kit already provides it by *denying* the operations the desktop design needs for NumPy.

## Approaches that fail or are insufficient


| Approach                                         | Why it fails for Online / new desktop                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Run the warm user-venv worker inside the kit** | Jail forbids fork/exec of arbitrary host Pythons and host venv paths; no `~/.writeragent_venv` story for multi-tenant cells.                                                         |
| `import numpy` **in LOKit’s embedded Python**    | Same [ABI crash risk](../enabling_numpy_in_libreoffice.md#1-the-problem-abi-and-embedded-python) as desktop in-process; one bad wheel can take the document kit with it; still no admin-curated scientific stack story. |
| **Only enable** `enable_macros_execution`        | Unlocks Basic/Python *playback* of image-baked scripts — not spawn of a user data-science stack or desktop extension UI.                                                             |
| **Pure-Python / Wasm-only cell runtime**         | Useful for light scripting; not a substitute for NumPy/pandas/scipy C-extension stacks.                                                                                              |
| **Ship pywebview Monaco into Online**            | Desktop windowing does not map onto browser canvas; Online already has a web UI surface for an editor.                                                                               |


**Jail-safe NumPy is not “put the current worker in a smaller box.” It is: do not run the scientific interpreter in the kit at all.**

## Proposed solution: native `=PY()` via thin C++ hooks → Python compute service

Track with Collabora: [online#16010](https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/issues/16010). Related AI/kit split (orchestration vs document mutation): [../chat/collabora-online-ai.md](../chat/collabora-online-ai.md).

**Goal:** real Calc **`=PY()`** on Online / new desktop (same formula surface as Classic — [§6](../enabling_numpy_in_libreoffice.md#6-the-py-calc-function)):

- **Small C++ hooks** in coolkit + coolwsd that call out to a Python compute service (same outbound-HTTP *shape* as AI chat’s `http::Session`).
- **All NumPy / packing / sandbox** stay in **Python** — C++ never implements [`split_grid`](numpy-serialization.md#strategy-3-split-grid-serialization-detail) or Pickle5.
- **Lightweight service** — **stdlib `http.server`** (or equivalent minimal HTTP) so coolwsd can POST JSON.

### Excel `xl()` compatibility is handled before execution

The Online bridge deliberately accepts the native, explicit-data surface `=PY(code, data…)`; it does not implement Microsoft's runtime `xl()` callback. Excel Python workbooks instead pass through the bidirectional rewriter in [`plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/`](../../plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/) (CLI, **auto-convert on open**, **ZipFile native export on save**; scripts **>1000 chars** use visible `py_code_<Sheet>` banks, shorter stay inline — full detail in [ms-py §5.8](ms-py-compatibility.md#58-ooxml--xlfnpy-import)):

```text
pythonScripts.xml:  df = xl(%P2%,headers=True)
worksheet cell:     _xlws.PY(0, 1, A1:C100)
                    │              │  └── %P2% = first trailing dep
                    │              └── returnType (headers= is on xl() in the script)
                    └── scriptIndex

%Pn% numbering: %P2% → first trailing dep, %P3% → second (idx = p_num - 2).

DAG code:           df = xl("%P2%",headers=True)   # sandbox xl looks up data / ranges
Calc formula:       =PY("..."; A1:C100)
```

(Bare `%Pn%` is quoted for valid Python; the sandbox injects a binding-only `xl` — [`excel_xl.py`](../../plugin/scripting/excel_xl.py). Legacy `data` / `.to_pandas()` DAG cells still reverse-export. Formula helpers are `calc.*`, not `xl`.)

This is important for both correctness and the jail boundary:

1. `A1:C100` becomes a real Calc formula precedent, so normal dirty tracking and DAG order still work.
2. coolkit extracts that already-declared range once and includes it in the request; Python `xl("%P2%")` only indexes that payload — no synchronous call back through service → wsd → kit.
3. The compute service remains document-blind: it receives code and plain values, not a capability for arbitrary live worksheet reads.

Excel scripts that share globals across multiple PY cells need a **shared** compute session so prior-stage Python names persist. The OOXML rewriter maps formula-static `xl()` ranges onto real `=PY` data precedents only; it does **not** inject synthetic prior-PY order edges (every trailing arg is a real binding). Enabling shared-kernel mode and managing run order is the operator’s responsibility (same advisory as LibrePy [§6](../enabling_numpy_in_libreoffice.md#session-modes-and-recalc-semantics)). A shared namespace without Calc precedents on real data ranges still will not refresh when those ranges change. `returnType` is preserved via conversion meta (`ExcelPyDagMeta` udprop on auto-open; CLI via `--from-report`). Table/`ANCHORARRAY` tokens are **A1 snapshots for Calc** and restored on Excel export for file fidelity only — not live Calc Table/spill support ([ms-py §5.8](ms-py-compatibility.md#58-ooxml--xlfnpy-import); code note in [`models.py`](../../plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/models.py)).

The rewriter handles formula-static references: fixed ranges, scalar cells, sheet-qualified table `[#All]` references, and `ANCHORARRAY`/spill anchors (the latter two become fixed A1 snapshots from workbook metadata). Microsoft does **not** productize true dynamic `xl(variable)` / `xl(f"A{n}")` (they fail in Excel). WriterAgent **fails closed** on those shapes if they appear (defense + not DAG-safe), and on missing table/anchor snapshots, rather than emitting shifted `data[i]` formulas. Sample fidelity: [`scripts/roundtrip_excel_py_samples.py`](../../scripts/roundtrip_excel_py_samples.py) over [`PythonExcelSamples/`](../PythonExcelSamples/).

#### Why we do not fold pure-subset ranges (research note)

A natural optimization idea: if one PY cell’s deps include both `A3` and `A1:A10`, the single cell is already inside the larger range, so import could keep only `A1:A10` on `=PY` and rewrite the small site as a view into `data`. That is the hard case. **Pure duplicates are already handled** and should not be confused with subset folding.

**Verdict: not worth doing in this stack.** Subset fold is correct as a pure-Python “don’t send the same cells twice” cleanup; expensive and fidelity-hostile once Calc precedents, `CalcRange` shapes, and Excel export are in the picture. Status quo: keep subset deps as separate formula args; keep collapsing identical A1s. Details below so we do not re-litigate it casually.

**What Excel actually stores.** Authors type `xl("A3")` in the UI; at edit/save Excel rewrites literals to formula-static bridges: `pythonScripts.xml` has `xl(%P2%)` / `xl(%P3%)` (`%P2%` = first trailing dep), and the cell formula is `_xlws.PY(scriptIndex, returnType, A3, A1:A10, …)`. Well-formed MS packages should not still contain UI-style `xl("A3")` string literals in the bank. True `xl(f"…")` / `xl(name)` is unsupported by Microsoft and fail-closed by WriterAgent if present. So both “duplicate fold” and “subset fold” mean collapsing **resolved trailing deps**, not scanning string literals in source.

**Pure duplicates (already done).** Authors often repeat the same `xl(...)` instead of `x = xl(...); … use x …`. On disk that becomes multiple `%Pn%` sites and repeated trailing deps, e.g. `_xlws.PY(…, A3, A3, A3)`. [`_normalize_bindings`](../../plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/to_dag.py) keys on the **exact** resolved A1 string after [`resolve_deps`](../../plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/resolve_refs.py): identical tokens collapse to one `data_args` entry, and a second rewrite remaps every original `%Pn%` site onto the same `data` / `ranges[i]` expression (with header-mode merge preferring explicit `headers=True`). That is identity-preserving — same Python value, one Calc precedent — and is covered by `test_dedup_duplicate_range_bindings`. From our side this is easier than asking authors to use a local: we only need one formula arg and N call sites pointing at it. Export prefers `excel_deps` when length-aligned with the collapsed `data_args` ([`deps_for_xlws_export`](../../plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/to_excel.py); policy in [`models.py`](../../plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/models.py)), so arity can shrink (`A3,A3` → one `A3` on re-export); that is acceptable for identical tokens.

**What is *not* done.** `A3` and `A1:A10` stay two `data_args` and two precedents. That is the subset idea below — different geometry, different value shapes, not another exact-key hit.

**Why a pure-Python fold feels easy.** In a world where `xl()` is just “fetch these cells into a dict of arrays,” you would union/parent the geometry, hand the script one buffer, and index the subset in user code. No formula engine, no reverse OOXML rewrite, no type contract with Microsoft’s bridge. That is not our world.

**Why Calc makes it a different story.**

1. **Value shape, not just bytes.** Microsoft’s docs/UI treat `xl("A3")` as a **scalar** and a multi-cell `xl("A1:A10")` as a frame/range. WriterAgent injects **`CalcRange`** for every binding ([`calc_range.py`](../../plugin/scripting/calc_range.py)): `__getitem__` is **row** access, so `data[2]` on a column range is a row list, not “the scalar that used to be `A3`.” Folding is not an `index_map` remap the way exact duplicates are; it needs a geometry rewrite that preserves the object shape each call site expects (scalar / 1×1 / row slice / 2D block), including `headers=True` → `.to_pandas()` vs bare `CalcRange`.

2. **`data[i]` already means binding index on the reverse path.** [`rewrite_dag_code_to_excel`](../../plugin/calc/excel_py_convert/to_excel.py) maps `data` / `data[i]` / `ranges[i]` back to `xl(%Pn%)` where `i` is the **nth formula dep**, not a sheet row offset. If import rewrote the `A3` site to `data[2]` meaning “row 2 of the parent,” export would invent a third `%Pn%` (or mis-bind), not restore `A3`. Subset fold needs a distinct IR (named view helper) or “export restores original script + original deps from meta and never reverse-rewrites slices.” Either is real design work, not a one-liner in `_normalize_bindings`.

3. **Round-trip fidelity fights collapsed arity.** `excel_deps` is parallel to collapsed `data_args`. Dropping `A3` from Calc args also drops what export can put on `_xlws.PY` unless meta grows a separate full original-dep list (Calc uses parent-only; Excel export uses the pre-collapse list). Exact `B1`,`B1` dedup already shrinks arity in a boring way; subset fold would shrink it in a visible, geometry-dependent way. “Perfect” Excel package restore and “smarter Calc wire” pull opposite directions unless that split meta exists.

4. **Unsafe cases beyond pure inclusion.** Different header modes on parent vs child; Table/`ANCHORARRAY` parent with a plain A1 child that only sits inside the snapshot; cross-sheet addresses; overlaps that are not subsets (`A1:A5` ∪ `A3:A10`). Only same-sheet, axis-aligned, inclusive subsets with compatible headers are even candidates — and those still hit (1)–(3).

5. **Payoff is usually small.** `A3` inside `A1:A10` saves almost nothing on the wire. The interesting win is large pure subsets (`A1:A5000` inside `A1:A10000`). Samples and common one-range cells do not justify the rewrite/export tax. Online’s jail-safe path already extracts each declared precedent once into the JSON request; duplicate small cells are cheap compared to an incorrect reverse rewrite.

**If someone revives this later**, the least-wrong sketch is: detect pure geometric subsets only; refuse header / Table-token conflicts; keep **full original deps** for `_xlws.PY` export; emit a DAG view helper that reverse will never confuse with binding indices (or skip reverse and restore original bridge text from meta); test scalar cell, column slice, 2D cell-in-block, conflict refuse, and Excel→DAG→Excel arity/token fidelity. Until measured large-subset pain appears, **leave subsets as separate precedents**.

### Split of responsibility

| Layer | Language | Does | Does not |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| Kit `=PY()` stub | C++ (small) | Register formula; on recalc read ranges via existing LOKit/cell APIs into **plain nested values**; send request up; apply returned scalar/matrix to cells | `split_grid`, Pickle, NumPy, AST sandbox |
| coolwsd | C++ (small) | Feature flag + URL config; `http::Session` POST/response routing (copy Online `AIChatSession` outbound HTTP) | Compute or dense packing logic |
| Compute service | **Python** | Parse dumb JSON → numpy/lists; optional internal [`payload_codec`](../../plugin/scripting/payload_codec.py) if talking to a warm worker; run sandboxed code; return JSON result | Live inside kit jail |

**Dumb JSON** means cell values LO already exposes (float / string / empty / error string)—not LibrePy’s binary `split_grid` envelope. Dense optimization happens **inside** the Python service when bridging to workers, if at all. The kit never loads NumPy.

### Python compute service

- Live tree: [`compute_service/`](../../compute_service/) (`server.py`, `config.py`, `executor.py`, [`json_egress.py`](../../compute_service/json_egress.py)); tests under `tests/compute_service/`.
- Listen with **stdlib** `http.server` / `ThreadingHTTPServer` (no FastAPI).
- `GET /health` → `{"status":"healthy","service":"python-compute","version":"1.0.0"}` (unauthenticated for orchestrator liveness/readiness probes).
- `POST /v1/execute` body: `{ "id?", "code", "data", "session_id?", "timeout_ms?", "mode?", "init_script?" }` → `{ "id?", "status", "result"|"error", "stdout?", "images?" }`.
- **Dumb JSON egress only** toward kit/coolwsd: ndarrays and `split_grid` become nested lists; NaN/Inf → `null`; `json.dumps(..., allow_nan=False)`. Plots go in top-level `images[]` (`format` + `data_b64`), not desktop Pickle envelopes.
- `mode`: `isolated` (default) ignores `session_id`; `shared` needs a session id and serializes executes per session with a lock.
- **Ops sidecar conventions**: Traps `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` for clean socket draining; structured logging with request durations (`PYTHON_COMPUTE_LOG_LEVEL`); request `id` correlation echo.
- Reuse desktop sandbox: [`venv_sandbox`](../../plugin/scripting/venv/venv_sandbox.py), import whitelist, curated Docker image (pinned numpy/pandas/**Pillow**/…).
- Prefer an **in-process executor in the service** first (fewer hops). Add Pickle5 warm workers later only if the service host needs ABI isolation.

### C++ hooks (deliberately dumb)

Live in the Collabora Online / LibreOffice trees (`collabofficefull`), not writeragent:

1. **Config:** `security.python_compute.enable` (default `false`), `url`, optional `api_key` (Bearer), `timeout_secs` in `coolwsd.xml.in` / `ConfigUtil.cpp`. No HTTP retries (formula POST is not idempotent).
2. **coolwsd:** `ClientSession::handlePythonComputeFromKit` — kit `pythoncompute:` → `http::Session` POST → `pythoncomputeresult:`.
3. **kit:** `PythonComputeEmitter` — spreadsheet-only install; one stable egress owner among live views (no last-wins steal); MOBILEAPP no-op; `handlePythonComputeResult` → `pythoncompute_complete_json` (no product browser echo). Retries `dlsym` until AddIn symbols resolve. Debug kick: `pythonexecute` (`ENABLE_DEBUG` only; rejects `py-*` ids).
4. **Core AddIn (Step C):** [`engine/scaddins/source/pythoncompute/`](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/collabofficefull/engine/scaddins/source/pythoncompute/) (`addin` / `anyjson` / `bridge` / `volatile`; no `pythoncompute_` filename prefix) — UNO `org.collaboraoffice.sheet.addin.PythonComputeFunctions`, C++ ns `collaboraoffice::pythoncompute`, `getPy` / `getPython`, `XVolatileResult` interim `"#BUSY!"`, param→volatile weak-ref identity map, **SolarMutex-only** (no extra `std::mutex`; `finish` under `SolarMutexGuard`), Any↔dumb JSON (see [JSON note](#anyjson-dumb-json-note)), pending map + timer. List/grid results → `sequence<sequence<…>>` → Core `ScMatrix` (see [matrix / spill](#matrix-list-results--auto-spill-not-yet)). No `FormulaError::Busy`.
5. **Future work:** see [below](#future-work-prototype--hardened-online). Monaco / browser cell editor remains a separate Online UI track (LibrePy uses pywebview; do not port that into the kit).

#### Cell markers / diagnosis (`#BUSY!`, `#DISABLED`, `#VALUE!`)

Volatile / finish values are **not** new Core `FormulaError` enum entries (Excel/Calc’s set stays fixed). Two existing Calc conventions coexist:

1. **True formula errors** — `CreateDoubleError` / void Any → cell `#VALUE!` / `#N/A`; Online `!` help + status bar show only fixed `GetLongErrorString` (e.g. “Error: No value”). Keeps `ISERROR` / `IFERROR`. **There is no free-form message field on `FormulaError`.**
2. **String markers** — plain `OUString` in the cell (same family as interim busy). Readable text, but **not** a formula error (`ISERROR` is false).

**Today (landed):**

| Cell shows | Kind | Meaning | Where |
|------------|------|---------|--------|
| `#BUSY!` | string | Request in flight | AddIn before `complete_json` |
| `#DISABLED` | string | Feature flag off | exact coolwsd error `"Python compute is disabled"` → literal in `jsonResultToAny` |
| `#VALUE!` | `FormulaError::NoValue` | Most `status=error`, bad JSON, missing `result` | opaque — **Python exception text is log-only** |
| `#N/A` | `FormulaError::NotAvailable` (void Any) | No emitter, pending timeout, superseded | Bridge lifecycle |

Service JSON `"error"` is parsed into `rError` and logged (`complete_json: detail=[…]`) then **discarded for the cell**. That is why a SyntaxError looks like every other `#VALUE!`.

**If `=PY()` shows `#DISABLED`:** turn on the flag in the **running** `coolwsd.xml` (or `--o:security.python_compute.enable=true`), restart coolwsd, and **reload the document** — the param→volatile cache can stick the finished disabled result until params change or the kit is fresh. Keep `coolwsd.xml.in` / ConfigUtil defaults **`false`** for git/upstream; local `coolwsd.xml` is the demo override.

Logs: coolwsd → `/tmp/coolwsd.log` (`Python compute: …`); Core AddIn → `export SAL_LOG=+INFO.scaddins.pythoncompute` or `+WARN.scaddins.pythoncompute` before starting coolwsd.

##### Planned: visible short Python errors (not implemented yet)

Authors need to **see** the Python failure cause without inventing a new Core error channel. Pure FormulaError-only cannot carry `SyntaxError: …` into the sheet or Online help (`GetLongErrorString` is fixed per code).

**Agreed direction (implement later in Core AddIn `jsonResultToAny` / bridge):**

| Cause | Cell | `ISERROR` | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| No emitter, pending timeout, superseded | `#N/A` | yes | keep |
| coolwsd infra: timeout / network / empty URL / allowlist | `#N/A` | yes | classify known `replyError` prefixes (today many of these still collapse to `#VALUE!`) |
| `"Python compute is disabled"` | `#DISABLED` | no | keep |
| Service `status=error` with a message (Python exception text, etc.) | **short string** | no | reuse `#DISABLED`-style escape hatch; first line / truncate ~200–256 chars; **no full traceback in the cell** |
| Bad JSON / missing `result` / empty error | `#VALUE!` | yes | no useful message |
| Empty `code` | `Err:502` | yes | already `IllegalArgumentException` |

Full detail (including truncated-away remainder) stays in `SAL_WARN`. Do **not** add new `FormulaError` enum values or custom Online `errorDescription` protocol for v1 of this fix. Track as [F6](#f6--visible-short-python-errors).

#### Matrix / list results / auto-spill (not yet)

JSON lists already convert to `sequence<sequence<double|Any>>` → `ScUnoAddInCall::SetResult` builds `ScMatrix` → interpreter `PushMatrix`. That path is real.

**Single-cell `=PY(...)` does not auto-spill.** If the formula was not entered as a matrix / dynamic-array formula, Core keeps **only the top-left** value and drops the rest:

```text
// engine/sc/source/core/data/formulacell.cxx (~2501–2508)
// If the formula wasn't entered as a matrix formula, live on with
// the upper left corner and let reference counting delete the matrix.
```

`=PY` is also not a Core “matrix function” for UI auto-dynamic-array promotion (`rpnIntendsArrayResult`), so typing `=PY("result = [1,2,3]")` + Enter yields **`1`**, not a spill of three cells and not `#VALUE!`.

| Single-cell → list/2D | Top-left only | `scripting.python_auto_spill` writes neighbors + `#SPILL!` |
| Ctrl+Shift+Enter matrix block | Full `ScMatrix` into declared range | matrix / index / spill paths |

**Future (do not forget — comments/README in tree when touching anyjson):** single-cell auto-spill for Online AddIn `PY` (LibrePy-style UNO write-back, or Core dynamic-array promotion for this AddIn). Not required for Gerrit of the thin tip. Track as [F7](#f7--single-cell-auto-spill). See also Classic docs [Dynamic auto-spill](../enabling_numpy_in_libreoffice.md#dynamic-auto-spill).

### Security invariants

1. **Compute is out-of-kit** — kit compromise ≠ host Python; Python compromise ≠ kit filesystem/network (seccomp, no capabilities, no docker.sock).
2. **Admin-baked image** — packages like Online macros today; **not** arbitrary tenant `pip` in multi-tenant Online.
3. **Per-document / per-session isolation** — no shared kernel across tenants; shared kernel only within one document session if enabled.
4. **Default deny** — no outbound network, no host mounts, scratch-only FS, hard CPU/RAM/wall-clock quotas.
5. **Separate feature flag** from `enable_macros_execution`.
6. **Import whitelist** inside the container ([`VENV_AUTHORIZED_IMPORTS`](../../plugin/scripting/venv/venv_sandbox.py)) as defense-in-depth; OS isolation is the real boundary.

### Product matrix

| Product | Execution backend | Editor |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Collabora Office Classic** + stock LibreOffice | **Local warm venv** (shipped) | Monaco via pywebview, or native dialog fallback |
| **Collabora Online** + **new web desktop** | **Python Compute Service** via thin coolwsd hooks | Browser Monaco / Online UI (no pywebview) |

Same `=PY(code, data…)` / `result =` semantics; different backends.

### Classic remote testing (optional)

Same HTTP API: a `RemoteComputeBackend` behind [`run_code_in_user_venv`](../../plugin/scripting/venv_worker.py) can POST dumb lists (or run local pack and use the service only for execute) so the **service** can be debugged without an Online rebuild.

### Explicit non-goals for the C++ tip

- No C++ port of [`payload_codec.py`](../../plugin/scripting/payload_codec.py) / `split_grid`
- No embedding user venvs or NumPy inside the kit jail
- No heavy Python web frameworks for the compute service

### Layout / build order

```
writeragent/
  compute_service/     # NEW — stdlib HTTP + sandbox + Dockerfile
  plugin/scripting/    # optional RemoteComputeBackend for Classic

collabora-online (kit/wsd)/
  kit/                 # =PY stub + dumb JSON extract/apply
  wsd/                 # feature flag + http::Session to python_compute_url
  coolwsd.xml.in       # enable_python_compute, python_compute_url
```

1. Python compute service + Dockerfile + tests against JSON grids.
2. Classic `RemoteComputeBackend` against the service (fast Python-only iteration).
3. C++ hooks: kit stub + coolwsd broker → wire works (`pythoncompute:` / `pythoncomputeresult:`; debug `pythonexecute`). **Landed in tree** — remaining submit gaps in [Still open before Gerrit](#still-open-before-gerrit).
4. Core `=PY()` AddIn + `#BUSY!` volatile + list→`ScMatrix` (single-cell = top-left only). **Landed in tree** (scaddins `pythoncompute` + kit emitter). Rebuild LibreOffice (`libpythoncomputelo.so`) + Online coolkit to pick up.
5. Future work below — NumPy smoke, plots / remaining container hardening / shared kernel, **visible short Python errors (F6)**, **auto-spill (F7)**. UnitWSD CI is done; caps / isolation / series still outrank F3–F5 for Collabora review.

Until Collabora ships images with Step C linked **and** the remaining open items below are acceptable for an experimental merge, **Classic** remains the product where full desktop NumPy `=PY()` works end-to-end without a Core rebuild.

---

## Future work (prototype → hardened Online)

AddIn `timeout_ms` emission is **deferred** (wsd defaults 60s; service clamps; pending map 90s). Browser Monaco / Edit-Python-in-cell for Online is **out of this list** (LibrePy pywebview is Classic-only).

### Ordered slices

| # | Slice | Primary tree | Why |
|---|-------|--------------|-----|
| F1 | UnitWSD wire CI — **done** | `collabofficefull/test/` | Proves kit↔wsd↔HTTP without waiting on Core rebuilds in CI |
| F2 | Scalar NumPy smoke | writeragent + local coolwsd | Human/demo proof NumPy never enters the kit |
| F3 | `images[]` sheet insert | Core AddIn + kit (+ maybe browser) | Service already emits plots; Online currently stubs a string |
| F4 | Compute container hardening | `compute_service/Dockerfile` + run scripts | Makes the OS boundary real for Collabora admins |
| F5 | Shared workbook kernel | AddIn + kit + service (already half-ready) | LibrePy `mode=shared` parity; tenant-safe session ids |
| F6 | Visible short Python errors | Core `jsonResultToAny` / bridge | Authors can see exception message in-cell (not opaque `#VALUE!`) |
| F7 | Single-cell auto-spill | Core AddIn (+ maybe Calc) | List/2D from single-cell `=PY` fills neighbors; today top-left only |

### F1 — UnitWSD wire test (`pythonexecute` → POST → `pythoncomputeresult:`)

**Status: implemented and passing in the current uncommitted tree (2026-07-23).** `test/UnitPythonCompute.cpp` is registered in
`test/Makefile.am`, builds as `unit-python-compute.la`, and passes locally.

**Goal:** CI-enforce the security claim that coolwsd is the only network hop, independent of LibreOffice AddIn mapping.

**Implemented (Online tree):**

- New: `test/UnitPythonCompute.cpp`, based on `WopiTestServer`, with enabled and disabled `UnitWSD` cases.
- Edited: `test/Makefile.am` — plugin source, library, and `all_la_unit_tests` registration.
- Reuse: `kit/ChildSession::requestPythonCompute` (`pythonexecute <json>`), `wsd/ClientSession::handlePythonComputeFromKit`, config knobs in `common/ConfigUtil.cpp` / `coolwsd.xml.in`.

The unit reuses the UnitWSD/WOPI listener as the local `/v1/execute` stub (no writeragent
or external service in CI). Once WSD has assigned its final port, `invokeWSDTest()` points
`security.python_compute.url` at that loopback endpoint. The handler asserts the POST method,
`id`, and `code`, records the POST, and replies:

```json
{"id":"wire-1","status":"ok","result":42}
```

The enabled case loads `empty.ods`, sends
`pythonexecute {"id":"wire-1","code":"result=1"}`, receives
`pythoncomputeresult:`, and asserts the id/status/result plus exactly one POST. The disabled
case drives the same kit path, asserts structured error `"Python compute is disabled"`, and
asserts zero POSTs. The debug-only browser command deliberately forwards even when disabled
so the broker's normal structured disabled response is covered end-to-end.

**Fallback path note:** `ChildSession::handlePythonComputeResult` echoes to the browser when `pythoncompute_complete_json` is not mapped (`dlsym` miss). That is **desirable** for F1: the unit proves broker HTTP without requiring `libpythoncomputelo.so` in the unit harness. Add a follow-up assert later once the test kit image links the AddIn (then `completeFromJson` returns 1 and the echo may stop).

**Out of scope for F1:** real NumPy, formula evaluation, `KIT_HOST_ALLOWLIST` matrix (cover with a third case only if allowlist is always-on in your install).

**Verified locally:**

- `test/run_unit.sh --test-name unit-python-compute.la` — pass (enabled + disabled).
- `make -C engine CppunitTest_scaddins_pythoncompute` — pass.
- `make coolwsd coolforkit-ns coolforkit-caps` — pass.

---

### F2 — Scalar NumPy smoke (manual / scripted demo)

**Goal:** One command path a Collabora engineer can run that shows `import numpy` succeeding **only** in the service process.

**Procedure (local):**

1. From writeragent: `python compute_service/server.py` (or `docker build -f compute_service/Dockerfile` + run `-p 8000:8000`). Confirm `GET /health` → `{"status":"healthy"}`.
2. coolwsd config (overrides):
   ```xml
   <python_compute desc="…" enable="true">
     <url desc="…" default="http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/execute"></url>
   </python_compute>
   ```
   Keep `security.python_compute.enable` **false** in ConfigUtil defaults; only the running `coolwsd.xml` enables it for the demo host.
3. Rebuild / install Online kit that embeds Step C (`libpythoncomputelo.so` on the kit `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` / LO foundation). Without it, `=PY()` finishes immediately with `"Python compute unavailable"`.
4. Open Calc Online, enter:
   ```text
   =PY("import numpy as np; result = float(np.sum([1,2,3]))")
   ```
   Expect interim `#BUSY!`, then `6`.
5. Process proof: `ps` / container logs show numpy import in the **service** PID, never in `coolkit`. Optionally add a temporary log line in `compute_service/executor.py` on successful `import numpy` in the sandbox namespace.

**Wire-only without formula:** browser/devtools WS:
```text
pythonexecute {"id":"smoke1","code":"import numpy as np\nresult = float(np.pi)"}
```
then watch `pythoncomputeresult:` (echo or volatile-complete).

**Keep scripts next to the service:** e.g. `compute_service/smoke_online.md` or a small shell that curls `/v1/execute` first (sanity), then prints the coolwsd XML snippet. Do not bake NumPy into Online's unit harness for F2.

**Done when:** documented smoke path works on a developer machine in <15 minutes without matrix spill expectations.

---

### F3 — Online `images[]` / plot insert

**Today:**

- Service [`json_egress.py`](../../compute_service/json_egress.py) promotes viz payloads to top-level `images: [{format, data_b64}]` and may null out `result`.
- Core [`pythoncompute_anyjson.cxx`](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/collabofficefull/engine/scaddins/source/pythoncompute/pythoncompute_anyjson.cxx) detects `"images"` + null result and finishes the volatile with the placeholder string `"Image generated (plot insert not supported yet)"`.
- Classic LibrePy inserts via [`plugin/scripting/viz.py`](../../plugin/scripting/viz.py) / [`insert_image_result_on_sheet`](../../plugin/calc/python/image_egress.py) on the UNO main thread — **not** available as-is inside coolkit jail policies.

**Design for Online (stay dumb in C++):**

Prefer **kit-side binary insert via existing LOK document APIs**, not reimplementing LibrePy's PyUNO insert stack.

1. **Wire extension (minimal JSON unchanged):** keep `images[]` as-is from the service. Do not base64-decode in coolwsd.
2. **After `pythoncompute_complete_json`:** when the body has non-empty `images[]`:
   - Decode PNG (v1: only `format=="png"`; reject others with cell error string).
   - Cap size (e.g. 8 MiB decoded) before alloc.
   - Insert graphic near the formula cell:
     - Prefer existing Online/kit paths used for pasted images / `.uno:InsertGraphic` equivalents already exercised by CopyPaste tests.
     - Anchor: formula cell address if available from LOKit; else active cell.
3. **Volatile result text:** if `result` is non-null, finish volatile with the numeric/string result **and** insert plots as side effect. If `result` is null/images-only, finish volatile with `""` or a short success marker — **not** leave `#BUSY!`.
4. **Where the decode lives:**
   - **Preferred:** kit (`ChildSession::handlePythonComputeResult`) after attempting `completeFromJson`, because LOKit document mutation APIs live there. Pass a side channel: either extend the AddIn ABI with `pythoncompute_take_pending_images` (ugly) **or** parse `images[]` in kit independently of the AddIn (duplicate JSON field walk — accept it; C++ tip stays free of NumPy).
   - **Avoid:** decoding megabyte base64 in coolwsd then shoving binary through kit protocol without size limits.
5. **Multi-image:** insert stacked / offset like Classic's multi-figure merge; v1 can take `images[0]` only and log a warning for the rest.
6. **Tests:**
   - Service already has compute_service image tests.
   - Add AddIn/CppUnit for "images + null result → empty/`""` not placeholder" once insert is wired (insert itself may stay UnitWSD / manual: graphic presence is painful in LOKit unit stubs).
   - UnitWSD: stub returns tiny 1×1 PNG base64; assert no hang + cell not `#BUSY!`; optional tile hash change if the unit infrastructure already supports it.

**Security:** treat `data_b64` as untrusted input from the **admin** compute service (same trust as LLM image returns). Still enforce size/format; do not execute anything in the image stream.

**Done when:** `=PY("import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; …; result = None")` with service returning `images[]` drops a PNG on the sheet in Online.

---

### F4 — Compute service container hardening

**Status: Dockerfile hardening + loopback/dual-stack bind configurations landed.**

**Goal:** Make the security invariants in this doc **operational**, not aspirational. The kit jail is only half the story; a compromised compute container must not become host RCE.

**Implemented:**

1. **Configurable / Safe Binding**: `server.py` defaults to binding to `127.0.0.1` (loopback only) instead of wildcard, preventing external exposure by default. It supports configuring the host via the `HOST` environment variable.
2. **Dual-Stack & IPv6**: Server binds using a dual-stack configuration (`DualStackThreadingHTTPServer`), allowing concurrent IPv4 and IPv6 connections on supported systems with graceful fallback.
3. **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: The [`compute_service/Dockerfile`](../../compute_service/Dockerfile) uses a multi-stage build where all compiler tools (`build-essential`) are restricted to the builder stage. The runner image copies pre-installed packages, reducing the runtime container's attack surface.
4. **Startup Dependency Check**: The server runs a pre-check to ensure required libraries like `sympy` are importable, failing fast at startup if dependencies are missing.
5. **Runtime flags (recommended for ops):**
   ```bash
   docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:rw,size=64m,mode=1777 \
     --memory=1g --cpus=1 --pids-limit=256 \
     --security-opt no-new-privileges \
     --cap-drop ALL \
     --network <internal-bridge-only> \
     -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
     …
   ```
   coolwsd on the host reaches `127.0.0.1:8000`; the container has **no** route to the public internet (tenant `urllib` / sockets die). If the sandbox AST already blocks many imports, network isolation is still the real boundary for C-extension sockets.
6. **No docker.sock, no privileged, no host FS mounts** of tenant data. Scratch only under `/tmp`. If models/weights are needed later, bake into the image (admin curates) — never bind-mount `~/.writeragent_venv`.
7. **Auth between coolwsd and service:** coolwsd sends optional `security.python_compute.api_key` as `Authorization: Bearer …`. The compute service verifies that Bearer only when a key is configured (`PYTHON_COMPUTE_API_KEY` / key file / `python-compute.json`); empty key = no auth (dev/test). Remaining ops: cgroup/network isolation ([F4](#f4--compute-service-container-hardening) / G5).
8. **Resource quotas already partially exist:** `timeout_ms` / `clamp_timeout_sec` in [`executor.py`](../../compute_service/executor.py); add RSS watch or rely on cgroup `--memory`. Document that wall-clock alone does not stop a malloc bomb — cgroup does.
9. **Health / readiness:** keep `/health` (`status`, `service`, `version`); orchestrators use it. Do not expose `/v1/execute` without the allowlist auth once enabled.
10. **Signal handling & structured logging:** `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` graceful shutdown for orchestrators; structured logging with request durations and configurable verbosity (`PYTHON_COMPUTE_LOG_LEVEL`). Request `id` is echoed on success and error payloads for async tracing.

### F5 — Shared workbook kernel (`mode:shared` + `session_id`)

**Today:**

- Service [`execute_code`](../../compute_service/executor.py) already honors `mode=="shared"` + non-empty `session_id`, with a per-id `threading.Lock`.
- Online AddIn [`buildExecuteRequestJson`](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/collabofficefull/engine/scaddins/source/pythoncompute/pythoncompute_anyjson.cxx) **hard-codes** `"mode": "isolated"` (via `tools::JsonWriter`) and never sends `session_id` / `init_script`.
- LibrePy derives workbook ids via [`session_manager.calc_workbook_base_session_id`](../../plugin/scripting/session_manager.py) and seeds init scripts from document properties.

**Online design constraints:**

- **Never** share a kernel across tenants / DocumentBrokers. `session_id` must include something unique to the doc instance coolwsd already trusts (e.g. docKey / jail id / `DocumentBroker::getDocKey()`), **not** a client-supplied string from formula text.
- Kit compromise forging `session_id` is OK only if coolwsd **overwrites** the id on the way out (wsd is the trust boundary for tenancy).

**Implementation sketch:**

1. **Config:** `security.python_compute.session_mode` = `isolated` \| `shared` (default isolated). Separate from macros. Matching LibrePy setting conceptually, but admin-global for Online v1 (per-doc UI later).
2. **coolwsd `handlePythonComputeFromKit`:** after parsing JSON, if shared mode:
   - Set `mode` to `shared`.
   - Set `session_id` to a server-derived string, e.g. `py:` + docKey (+ view id **not** included — workbook-scoped like Classic).
   - Strip any client/kit-provided `session_id` (ignore untrusted).
   - Optionally inject `init_script` once per docKey (cache flag on DocumentBroker) by reading a document property via an existing kit command if available; v1 can skip init and only share namespace across `=PY` cells.
3. **AddIn:** keep emitting isolated always **or** emit `mode` omit and let wsd decide — prefer **wsd owns mode** so a rebuilt AddIn is not required to flip admin policy.
4. **Lifecycle:**
   - On DocumentBroker destroy / last session leave: `POST /v1/session/reset` (new service endpoint) or include `reset:true` on next unused call — implement `reset` in executor by dropping sandboxed globals for that `session_id` (mirror LibrePy `reset_python_session`).
   - TTL: expire idle shared sessions in the service (dict + last-used timestamp) to bound memory.
5. **Recalc semantics:** document Online limitation — without Excel-style co-volatility, multi-cell shared-kernel scripts need real `data` precedents for dirtying and operator-managed run order (same advisory as LibrePy §6; the OOXML rewriter does not invent prior-PY edges). Do not invent Online co-volatility in v1.
6. **Tests:**
   - Service unit: two sequential executes with same `session_id` share a name; different ids do not.
   - UnitWSD: enable shared; `pythonexecute` twice with `code` setting then reading a global; assert second sees first; second docKey does not.

**Multi-tenant footgun:** if anyone ever points two coolwsd instances at one compute service without unique docKeys globally, kernels can collide — prefix with deployment id / hostname in `session_id`.

**Done when:** admin can flip shared mode and two `=PY` cells in one Online doc share `x = 1` / `result = x + 1` without shipping LibrePy into the jail.

---

### F6 — Visible short Python errors

**Goal:** When `=PY()` fails with a Python/service message, the **cell shows a short readable string** (exception message), not opaque `#VALUE!`. Infra failures stay true formula errors.

**Why FormulaError alone is not enough:** Calc packs errors as `FormulaError` in a NaN (`CreateDoubleError`). Display is fixed short/long strings (`GetErrorString` / `GetLongErrorString`). Online’s `CellFormulaError` help button only re-shows those fixed strings. Free-form Python text **cannot** ride on a formula-error cell. Exception text is already parsed into `rError` and logged, then discarded for the cell today.

**Reuse existing conventions (no new Core UX):**

1. **Infra** (timeout, network, no emitter, allowlist, empty URL) → `FormulaError::NotAvailable` → `#N/A` (`ISERROR` true). Classify known coolwsd `replyError` prefixes in `jsonResultToAny` (several of these still become `#VALUE!` today).
2. **Disabled** → keep `#DISABLED` string.
3. **Service `status=error` with message** → finish volatile with **short `OUString`** (first line / truncate ~200–256 chars; no full traceback). Same escape hatch as `#DISABLED` / `#BUSY!`. **`ISERROR` is false** for these cells — acceptable tradeoff so authors can see the cause.
4. **Parse / missing result / empty error** → keep `#VALUE!` (`NoValue`).
5. Log full detail at `SAL_WARN` (`complete_json: detail=[…]`).

**Files:** `engine/scaddins/source/pythoncompute/pythoncompute_anyjson.cxx` (`jsonResultToAny`), `pythoncompute_bridge.cxx` (log level), README + CppUnit in `engine/scaddins/qa/pythoncompute.cxx`.

**Out of scope for F6:** new `FormulaError` enum values, custom Online `errorDescription` protocol, full stack traces in cells.

**Done when:** `=PY("result = 1/0")` (or service SyntaxError) shows a short message in the cell; timeout still `#N/A`; disabled still `#DISABLED`; CppUnit covers the matrix above.

---

### F7 — Single-cell auto-spill

**Goal:** Single-cell `=PY(...)` returning a list / 2D array fills adjacent cells (Excel / LibrePy parity), with `#SPILL!` when blocked.

**Today:** list→`ScMatrix` works, but non-matrix formulas keep **top-left only** (`formulacell.cxx` ~2501–2508). Matrix formula (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) over a range still works for full grids.

**Options (pick when implementing):**

- LibrePy-style deferred UNO write into neighbors + spill registry (`scripting.python_auto_spill` pattern in Classic), or
- Promote AddIn `PY` into Core dynamic-array eligibility / matrix-function intent so Calc’s native spill path runs.

**Until then:** leave **code comments** near `elemsToAny` / README so this is not forgotten. Do not block Gerrit on F7.

**Done when:** single-cell `=PY("result = [1,2,3]")` spills three cells (or shows `#SPILL!` if blocked), matching Classic auto-spill expectations.

---

### Explicitly deferred (not proto-blocking)

| Item | Why deferred |
|------|----------------|
| AddIn-emitted `timeout_ms` | WSD admin `timeout_secs` (default 60s); service clamps; pending map 90s |
| Browser Monaco / cell editor | Separate Online UI project; LibrePy pywebview is Classic-only |
| C++ `split_grid` / Pickle5 | Violates the dumb-JSON tip on purpose |
| Kit-side NumPy / warm venv | Jail-incompatible by design |
| Visible short Python errors in cell | **Deferred — design agreed, not coded.** See [cell markers](#cell-markers--diagnosis-busy-disabled-value) + [F6](#f6--visible-short-python-errors). Today: detail log-only; cell `#VALUE!` / `#N/A` / `#DISABLED` |
| Single-cell auto-spill | **Deferred — documented only.** See [matrix / spill](#matrix-list-results--auto-spill-not-yet) + [F7](#f7--single-cell-auto-spill). Today: top-left only |
| Per-document cache keying | Process-wide weak-ref identity map (soft cap 256, never evicts live entries); cleared on kit teardown — no per-`ScDocument` map (AddIn has no doc pointer; Core shares one volatile across docs) |

---

## Still open before Gerrit

Pre-submit review (2026-07) against commits that land Steps B/C. Architecture (out-of-kit compute, thin C++ tip, default-off flag, host allowlist) is the right shape. Correctness / multi-view / MOBILEAPP / typed JSON / `pythonexecute` issues from that review are **done in tree** and no longer expanded here.

**Still expect review friction** until the items below are addressed or explicitly scoped as experimental follow-ups in the PR cover letter.

### Open checklist

| # | Topic | Status |
|---|--------|--------|
| G4 | No size / in-flight caps | **Service-side done** (`max_body_bytes`, `max_code_chars`, `max_inflight`, `max_inflight_per_session` in `compute_service`). WSD POST caps still deferred for Collabora |
| G5 | Service isolation | Bearer verify when key set; empty key = open (dev); cgroup/network isolation still ops — [F4](#f4--compute-service-container-hardening) |
| G6a | Pending timeout is passive | Done — AddIn one-shot `vcl::Timer` expires pending → `#N/A` without recalc |
| G6c | LRU breaks AddIn.idl identity; sticky errors | Done — weak-ref identity map never evicts live entries; sticky retry = change params (documented) |
| G8 | UnitWSD / formula-level CI | UnitWSD done; full formula-level Online CI remains optional follow-up |
| G9 | Series / hygiene | Hygiene done; series preparation remains intentionally pending |
| G10 | Opaque `#VALUE!` hides Python message | Open / deferred — design in [F6](#f6--visible-short-python-errors); not coded |
| G11 | No single-cell auto-spill | Open / deferred — documented in [F7](#f7--single-cell-auto-spill); top-left only today |

### Any↔JSON (dumb JSON note)

**Landed in tree** as the Core ↔ service dialect (keep for contracts / F3 plots / shared kernel). **Do not merge** this into jsuno: typed `appendUnoAsJson` / `parseJsonToAny` (optional QuickJS) is a different contract. Keep Poco in coolwsd. `tools::JsonWriter` is already the shared encoder. See [Do not regress](#do-not-regress-meeks-2026-08).

- **Emit:** `tools::JsonWriter` in `anyjson.cxx` — Calc ranges as `Sequence<Sequence<…>>` first, then flatten 1×N / N×1 when useful (Any **and** typed double grids).
- **Parse:** local hand parser in the same file (not `boost::property_tree`, not Boost.JSON, not Poco in Core). It combines UTF-16 surrogate pairs, rejects unpaired surrogates/trailing junk, and rejects ragged nested arrays. Online coolwsd stays on Poco/`JsonUtil`.
- **Scalars:** JSON `"42"` / `"true"` / `"null"` stay strings; bare `42` / `true` / `null` → double / bool / empty string (Classic `None` parity).
- **Grids:** nested lists; rectangular numerics → `sequence<sequence<double>>`; mixed → `sequence<sequence<Any>>`; one-element lists of every scalar type stay 1×1 matrices. Single-cell formulas keep **top-left only** until [F7](#f7--single-cell-auto-spill).
- **Envelope:** `id`, `status`, `error`, `result`, optional `images[]` (sheet insert still [F3](#f3--images-sheet-insert); Core shows a placeholder string today).
- **Tests:** `engine/scaddins/qa/pythoncompute.cxx` + writeragent `tests/compute_service/test_online_py_json_contract.py`.

### G4 — No request / response / in-flight resource caps

**Impact:** High / DoS once the feature is on. Prototype leaves this open on purpose.

**Evidence:** `handlePythonComputeFromKit` posts the full kit JSON body with no max size, no max `code` length, no per-session/doc concurrent POST counter. HTTP responses use `response->getBody()` with only the generic http max (~2 GB). Client JSON may carry `timeout_ms` up to ~620 s wall clock. AI chat already enforces payload caps.

**Recommended solution:**

1. Config knobs: `max_request_bytes`, `max_response_bytes`, `max_inflight_per_doc`, admin-owned `timeout_secs`.
2. Hard-reject oversized bodies with `status=error` JSON back to kit.
3. Fail-visible handling for corrupt `pythoncompute:` frames (`replyError`) — **done**.
4. Cancel in-flight HTTP on disconnect; optionally cap AddIn `g_aPending`.

### G5 — Compute-service isolation claims are not operational

**Status: Mostly resolved for auth/bind.** Loopback-only (`127.0.0.1`) host binding by default, multi-stage Dockerfile hardening, coolwsd optional `security.python_compute.api_key` Bearer on POST, and **service-side** Bearer verification when a key is set (`compute_service/config.py` + `authenticate_request`). Empty key ⇒ no auth (dev/test). Config is standalone (`PYTHON_COMPUTE_*` / `python-compute.json`) — not `writeragent.json`.

**Still open (ops):** cgroup `--memory`/`--cpus`, private bridge networking, no docker.sock — complete remainder of [F4](#f4--compute-service-container-hardening); do not claim AST sandbox is the OS boundary.

### G6 — Remaining lifecycle gaps

#### G6a — Pending timeout is passive — **done**

AddIn arms a process-wide one-shot `vcl::Timer` to the earliest `g_aPending` deadline (default 90 s, cushion above WSD’s ~60 s HTTP timeout). `Invoke` reuses `expireStale_NoLock` + `finishExpired` under Solar (Unipoll feeds SalTimer into `kitPoll`). Idle sheet + silent service → `#N/A` without another `startCompute` / `complete_json`. CppUnit: `test_pendingTimeoutWithoutRecalc`.

#### G6c — LRU breaks AddIn.idl identity; sticky errors — **done**

`g_aParamCache` is now a process-wide param→volatile map of `unotools::WeakReference`s (same shape as `AccessibleSpreadsheet::m_mapCells`). A still-live entry is **never** evicted, so `getPy` returns the same `XVolatileResult` for the same params even past the soft cap — no duplicate HTTP emit. `kParamCacheSoftCap` (256) only prunes lapsed weaks; the live set may grow past it (like `ScAddInAsync`, bounded by listeners). A weak lapses once no cell holds the volatile **and** the request finished (in-flight `#BUSY!` is pinned by `g_aPending`). Kit teardown calls `pythoncompute_clear_caches` from `clearEmitter` (last session) for memory — not identity. Sticky finished success/error stays v1; retry = change `code`/`data`. CppUnit: `test_paramCacheIdentityUnderPressure`, `test_paramCacheDropsLapsedWeak`.

### G8 — Test coverage gaps

Core CppUnit now also covers Unicode surrogate pairs, one-element string/bool matrices,
mixed numeric/string rows, rectangular columns, ragged-array rejection, and trailing/invalid
JSON. UnitWSD covers enabled/disabled routing, the local POST, response id/status/result, and
the zero-POST disabled invariant. Remaining coverage gaps:

| Area | Missing today |
|------|----------------|
| UnitWSD | allowlist reject; direct corrupt upward-frame injection (production handler now replies with structured error) |
| Lifecycle | disconnect mid-flight (timeout-without-recalc covered by AddIn CppUnit) |
| Limits | oversize body rejected; inflight cap (when G4 lands) |

[F1](#f1--unitwsd-wire-test-pythonexecute--post--pythoncomputeresult) is implemented and registered with the Online unit suite.

### G9 — Commit series, naming, and hygiene

#### Do not regress (Meeks 2026-08)

From [forum #15](https://forum.collaboraonline.com/t/py-numpy-inside-collabora/4844/15) / [Gerrit 8122](https://gerrit.collaboraoffice.com/c/online/+/8122). **1+ε** means “basically one thread + a little extra concurrency through SolarMutex,” not “one lock plus epsilon other locks.”

| Rule | Do not | Do |
|------|--------|----|
| **SolarMutex 1+ε** | Re-add `std::mutex` on pending / param cache / volatile | Shared AddIn state is Solar-only. Kit Unipoll may arrive with Solar released; `complete_json` / `finish()` re-acquire. Keep snapshot-then-finish. |
| **Filenames** | `pythoncompute_` prefix on sources | `addin` / `anyjson` / `bridge` / `volatile` under `pythoncompute/`. C ABI symbols (`pythoncompute_set_emitter`, …) keep the prefix. |
| **Configure vs runtime** | Drop `--disable-python-compute`, or default the runtime flag on | AddIn on by default; omit with `--disable-python-compute`. `security.python_compute.enable` stays default **false**. Run CppUnit + `unit-python-compute` with the AddIn enabled. |
| **UNO ↔ JSON** | Merge `anyjson` into jsuno, or pull Poco into the AddIn | Typed jsuno (`appendUnoAsJson` / `parseJsonToAny`, optional QuickJS) is a different contract from untyped compute-wire JSON. `tools::JsonWriter` is the shared encoder. Later share, if any: string escape/parse (maybe a tiny scalar/array helper) in `tools`/`comphelper`; Calc matrix / envelope / errors stay in the AddIn. Pieces found so far; Core is large, we may have missed others. |
| **Scope** | Excel Table / live ANCHORARRAY / co-volatility / torture-sheet engines in the AddIn | Piece-wise C++ tip only. Torture samples stay WriterAgent (`PythonExcelSamples/` + roundtrip script) until Collabora asks for gold. |

#### Cursor `Co-authored-by` on Gerrit commits

Cursor’s git wrapper appends `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` to **`git commit` and `git commit --amend`**, even with a HEREDOC that only has `Signed-off-by` + `Change-Id`. The Collabora `.git-hooks/commit-msg` / `prepare-commit-msg` hooks are **not** the source. Several AIs worked on this series; do not upload that trailer.

**Do not use `git commit` from Cursor.** Create the commit with `git write-tree` + `git commit-tree` (Cursor does not inject a trailer there), verify, then push. Same recipe for a new patchset of an existing Change-Id: put the intended message (including the old `Change-Id`) in `$MSG_FILE` and use `-p HEAD` for a new commit or `-p HEAD^` to replace HEAD.

```bash
# index already has what you want (git add / git add -u)
MSG_FILE=$(mktemp)
# paste the intended commit message into $MSG_FILE — Signed-off-by + Change-Id, no Co-authored-by
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='Keith Curtis' GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='keithcu@gmail.com'
export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="$(date -R)"          # or keep: git log -1 --format=%aD  when replacing HEAD
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME='Keith Curtis' GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL='keithcu@gmail.com'
TREE=$(git write-tree)
PARENT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)                 # new commit on top of HEAD
# PARENT=$(git rev-parse HEAD^)              # instead: replace HEAD (Gerrit amend / new patchset)
NEW=$(git commit-tree "$TREE" -p "$PARENT" -F "$MSG_FILE")
git reset --soft "$NEW"
rm -f "$MSG_FILE"
git log -1 --format='%B' | grep -iE 'Co-authored-by|Cursor' || echo clean
git push cogerrit HEAD:refs/for/main
```

`git cherry-pick` of an already-clean commit kept the original message (no trailer). If you already ran `git commit` / `--amend` and the trailer is on HEAD, the `-p HEAD^` variant above rewrites that commit without going through `git commit` again. Re-check `git log` before every Gerrit push.

- Prepare **Core AddIn** vs **Online kit/wsd** review boundaries when requested; no split or commits have been made during the current cleanup.
- Explicit PR/IDL note on display name `PY` vs Excel semantics.
- en-US-only strings / `SAL_DLLPUBLIC_EXPORT` test helpers remain nits. The IDL volatile-runtime comment is corrected.
- Cover letter: #16010, experimental + default off, non-goals (plots, shared kernel, Monaco), residual risk = G4/G5 plus the remaining formula/allowlist/lifecycle gaps under G8.

Suggested series:

```text
1) Core: Calc =PY() scaddins pythoncompute AddIn + CppunitTest
2) Online: kit emitter + coolwsd broker + config (+ UnitWSD when ready)
```

### Reviewer-facing cleanup (not blockers alone)

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| `EmitFn` ABI type | Done — Core C ABI and kit use fixed-width `int32_t` / `std::int32_t` |
| Duplicated anyjson writers | Done — emit TypeClass ladders factored through `writeAnyValue` (same wire) |
| IWYU filter | Update `IwyuFilter_scaddins.yaml` if CI enables it |
| en-US-only help | Accept for v0.1 with PR note; follow with `.hrc` |
| Engine subtree README | Updated for the hand parser, matrix behavior, and actual dependencies |

### What already looks good (keep)

- Out-of-kit compute; C++ tip free of NumPy / `split_grid` / Pickle5.
- `security.python_compute.enable` default `false`; optional `api_key` / `timeout_secs`; `HostUtil::isForbiddenKitHost` when allowlist set.
- UNO package `org.collaboraoffice.sheet.addin.*` (not `com.sun.star.sheet.addin` for this AddIn).

### File interop with LibrePy / WriterAgent (desktop)

Calc stores add-in formulas as **OriginalName** (`ServiceName.MethodName`), not display `=PY()`. Collabora cells are `ORG.COLLABORAOFFICE.SHEET.ADDIN.PYTHONCOMPUTEFUNCTIONS.GETPY(...)` (IDL `getPy`). LibrePy registers `org.extension.writeragent.PythonFunction` / `py` — a different token — so those files `#NAME?` unless rewritten.

LibrePy **does not** register Collabora's UNO service (that would add a second Function Wizard name and collide with Collabora Office Classic). On `OnLoadFinished` it prefix-rewrites `GETPY`/`GETPYTHON` to `=PY(`/`=PYTHON(` so the existing add-in runs. Code: [`plugin/calc/python/collabora_formula.py`](../../plugin/calc/python/collabora_formula.py). New LibrePy cells still **write** writeragent names. Online opening those files still needs a Core alias the other direction.

`XCompatibilityNames` → `PY` is Excel short-name mapping, not two-UNO-identity mapping.
- Typed dumb-JSON round-trip; Calc range grids emit; **SolarMutex-only** (no extra `std::mutex`); snapshot-then-finish; early spreadsheet emitter; stable multi-view owner; MOBILEAPP compile-out.
- gbuild / `.component` / IDL for the Collabora Office AddIn.
