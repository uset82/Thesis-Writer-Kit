# LLM Evaluation Suite & Benchmarks

WriterAgent includes an in-LibreOffice **LLM Evaluation Suite** for real-world tasks in Writer, Calc, and Draw. Runs track accuracy and **Intelligence-per-Dollar**: **Value (C²/$)** = average correctness squared ÷ average dollars per run (higher is better), using live OpenRouter pricing where available.

How to run evals from the repo: [scripts/prompt_optimization/README.md](../../scripts/prompt_optimization/README.md). Broader plan notes: [dev-plan.md](dev-plan.md).

## Snapshot ranking (Apr 2026)

Apr 2026 snapshot — slugs and prices may be stale. Current default eval models live in [`scripts/prompt_optimization/model_configs.py`](../../scripts/prompt_optimization/model_configs.py).

## Key insights from that snapshot

1. **Verbosity vs cost**: Qwen 3.5-35B-A3B used more tokens than Qwen 3.5-122B-A10B but still scored higher Value (C²/$) because average $/run was lower. Token count alone does not determine dollar efficiency.
2. **C² punishes unreliable cheap runs**: Low correctness (e.g. OLMo ~0.32) collapses value even at low cost; “free” models with middling correctness also underperform on this metric.
3. **Value leader**: `openai/gpt-oss-120b` paired high correctness (~0.98) with very low average cost (~$0.00025). Gemini 3 Flash was a strong second.
4. **Near-ceiling mid-pack**: Qwen 3.5-27B (~0.993 correctness) and Grok 4.1 Fast (~0.95) remain useful accuracy-first picks when cheaper high-Value models dominate the ranking.

## Scoring approach

Structural tasks are scored from the **exported final document** (HTML / Draw tree / Calc grid) via result oracles — not tool-name traces. Creative tasks (resume, logical rewriting, summarization) still use an LLM judge (default `openai/gpt-oss-120b`; the retired `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast` 404s) plus gold references in `gold_standards.json` (hand-written from the rubrics). That separates fast “Flash” models from frontier models with better taste for professional documents.

**Fine-tuning direction:** the same eval signal (correct vs incorrect tool use, minimal vs verbose traces) could train a smaller specialist for this tool distribution—fewer tokens at similar correctness, better Value (C²/$).
