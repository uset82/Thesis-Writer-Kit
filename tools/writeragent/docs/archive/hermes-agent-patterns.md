# Hermes agent patterns (memory & skills)

WriterAgent adopts substantial design from [Nous Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent): file-backed **memory**, procedural **skills** (`SKILL.md` layout), ACP as an external agent backend, todo/planning stores, tool-call parsers, and JSON repair patterns. This document is the **canonical** reference for upstream patterns, current WriterAgent implementation, and integration priorities.

**Entry points:** [`plugin/chatbot/memory.py`](../plugin/chatbot/memory.py), [`plugin/chatbot/skills.py`](../plugin/chatbot/skills.py), [`plugin/framework/prompts.py`](../plugin/framework/prompts.py) (`MEMORY_GUIDANCE`, injection in `get_chat_system_prompt_for_document`).

**Status (2026-06):** `upsert_memory` + `USER.md` injection are active. The first skill (`humanizer`) ships with ambient prompt injection only (Settings checkbox). General skills list/view/manage tools remain aspirational.

**Skills catalog (refreshed 2026-08):** Still only humanizer shipped — no further skills were added. The table below replaces the older “plan / OCR / arxiv / llm-wiki” shortlist after a pass over current Hermes bundled + optional skills. Not scheduled work; parked so the next seeds are not rediscovered from scratch.

---

## Concepts

| Concept | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Memory** | Persistent files for long-lived facts: a **user** profile (`USER.md` — preferences, quirks) and a general **memory** note (`MEMORY.md` — project facts, environment). |
| **Skills** | Reusable **procedures** stored as `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (optional YAML front matter, body instructions). Supports extra files (templates, snippets). |

Together they let the model accumulate stable context (memory) and codify workflows (skills). Save when the user corrects you, when you learn about the environment, after complex multi-tool work, or when a skill is wrong and needs patching.

---

## Hermes reference patterns (upstream)

WriterAgent’s memory/skills modules are **inspired by** Hermes. The useful pattern: **the model sees saved memory in the system prompt every turn**, and uses the **`memory` tool mainly to write** (and occasionally to read **live** disk after mid-session updates). It does **not** rely on the main chat model repeatedly calling `memory` with `read` just to “load” preferences.

### Automatic reading (prompt injection)

Hermes loads `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` from disk when the session’s system prompt is built. A **frozen snapshot** of that content is **appended to the cached system prompt** (upstream `run_agent.py` `_build_system_prompt`, `tools/memory_tool.py` `format_for_system_prompt`). Official docs: `website/docs/developer-guide/prompt-assembly.md` (“Memory snapshots”, “frozen MEMORY snapshot”, “frozen USER profile snapshot”).

**Implications:**

- Facts like a favorite color scheme **are visible without** the model issuing a `memory read` first, as long as they were saved before the snapshot was taken and fit within configured character budgets.
- **Mid-session** `add` / `replace` / `remove` update **files on disk** immediately, but Hermes **does not rewrite** the cached system prompt on every tool call (that keeps LLM **prefix caching** stable). The **tool result** from `memory` reflects **live** content; the **system prompt** stays on the old snapshot until a **new session** or a **prompt rebuild** (e.g. after context compression / reload from disk).

So in Hermes, **“reading” for normal work is automatic via the prompt**; the tool’s **`read` action** is for **inspecting current file contents** when that differs from the frozen snapshot.

### Background “should we save anything?” pass (second agent)

Hermes spawns a **separate short-lived `AIAgent`** in a **background thread** after the **main** reply finishes, so saving does not compete with the user’s task.

- **Trigger (memory):** turn-based counter; default **every N user turns** (`memory.nudge_interval`, default **10**), when the memory store is active.
- **Trigger (skills):** after a turn completes, based on **tool-iteration** counters vs `skill_nudge_interval`.
- **Mechanism:** `_spawn_background_review` clones the conversation snapshot, appends a fixed **review user message** (`_MEMORY_REVIEW_PROMPT`, `_SKILL_REVIEW_PROMPT`, or combined), runs **`run_conversation`** with **`quiet_mode`**. The review agent may call **`memory`** / **`skill_manage`** to persist; optional compact **`💾 …`** summary if something was written.

This is **not** implemented in WriterAgent today. It is part of why Hermes feels low-friction: the **foreground** model does not have to audit every session for saves.

### Upstream memory hardening (not yet in WriterAgent)

Hermes’ `tools/memory_tool.py` is more defensive than WriterAgent’s flat-file version:

- Explicit **frozen snapshot** (`_system_prompt_snapshot`) vs. live mutable state — snapshot at `load_from_disk()`, injected once; writes hit disk but do **not** mutate the prompt.
- `§`-delimited entries for robust multiline storage.
- Load-time **threat/injection scanner** (“strict” scope). Poisoned entries become `[BLOCKED: ...]` in the *snapshot only*; raw text remains visible via `memory read/remove` for cleanup.
- **External drift detection** on writes (manual edits, concurrent sessions) → `.bak.<ts>` and refused mutation with remediation instructions.
- File locking + atomic replace, per-target char limits, deduplication.

**Recommendation:** Adopt snapshot + scanner + drift guard first; skip a full § parser if flat `USER.md` works for most users.

Hermes also injects a **skills index** into the system prompt when skill tools are enabled.

---

## Design alternatives

### Opaque side-channel memory

Keep **memory completely off the main agent’s tool surface**:

- The chat model never receives a memory tool definition and never sees tool results for stored content.
- **Reading** is **injection only**: e.g. `[USER PROFILE / MEMORY]` assembled from disk. Ambient context, like product rules—not something it “fetched.”
- **Writing** happens behind the scenes: background reviewer, “Remember this” UI, user-edited markdown, or non-LLM rules.

**Why consider it:** fewer tools and failure modes in the main loop, lower cognitive load, clear split between document tools and long-term prefs.

**Tradeoffs:** the main agent cannot voluntarily persist mid-turn without another channel. Stale memory must be fixed by users, settings, or the reviewer. Skills can stay on the tool surface, move to injection-only, or hybrid.

This reuses [`MemoryStore`](../plugin/chatbot/memory.py); omit registering [`MemoryTool`](../plugin/chatbot/memory.py) for sidebar chat and strip **`MEMORY_GUIDANCE`** that tells the model to use the tool.

### Who should update memory?

- **Reviewer-primary** — Background pass decides what to save; main model focuses on document work.
- **Main-agent `upsert_memory` tool** — One extra tool; with injection supplying reads, the tool is mostly **writes**. Immediate save when the user says “remember that.”
- **Hybrid** — Inject every turn; reviewer handles passive extraction; expose `upsert_memory` but soft-prompt it (“only when the user explicitly asked or a correction must not wait”).

### Librarian vs writer (onboarding and handoff)

Split **who you are** from **what we edit** using **different tool sets**, not necessarily a different session:

- **Librarian surface** — Reduced tools (memory/skills/chat only). Same sidebar session and history; onboarding chat seeds `USER.md`.
- **Writer surface** — Full Writer tool list (or nested Writer delegation per [`../writer/specialized-toolsets.md`](../writer/specialized-toolsets.md)).

**Precedent:** Web research already branches on a checkbox in [`panel.py`](../plugin/chatbot/panel.py) / [`web_research.py`](../plugin/chatbot/web_research.py). Librarian mode is implemented in [`librarian.py`](../plugin/chatbot/librarian.py). See [`../chat/librarian-onboarding.md`](../chat/librarian-onboarding.md) for onboarding details.

## WriterAgent implementation (current)

### Memory ([`memory.py`](../plugin/chatbot/memory.py))

**Storage:** `{user_config_dir(ctx)}/memories/`

- **`USER.md`** — target `user` (the only target `upsert_memory` writes today)
- **`MEMORY.md`** — target `memory` (path exists in `MemoryStore`; not yet used by the tool)

**`MemoryStore`:** `read(target)` / `write(target, content)` — flat file per target (not Hermes’s §-delimited / dual-snapshot structure).

**`upsert_memory` tool** (`name = "upsert_memory"`):

- Parameters: `key` (string, supports dot nesting), `content` (string; empty deletes the key)
- Reads existing `USER.md` as JSON object (rebuilds from scratch if invalid/legacy content)
- Nested key update via dot-separated path; writes indented JSON back to `USER.md`
- Registered via `auto_discover` in [`plugin/chatbot/__init__.py`](../plugin/chatbot/__init__.py)

**Injection:** In `get_chat_system_prompt_for_document` ([`prompts.py`](../plugin/framework/prompts.py)), when `USER.md` is non-empty:

```
[USER PROFILE / MEMORY]
{contents}
```

Librarian path also injects user memory ([`librarian.py`](../plugin/chatbot/librarian.py)).

**Prompt guidance:** `MEMORY_GUIDANCE` is woven into the Writer default system prompt template (`DEFAULT_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`) — explains when to save proactively (corrections, environment discoveries).

### Skills ([`skills.py`](../plugin/chatbot/skills.py))

**Storage:** `{user_config_dir(ctx)}/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — Hermes-compatible layout.

**Shipped: humanizer**

- Ambient `[HUMANIZER GUIDANCE]` injection when `chatbot.humanizer_enabled` (Settings checkbox in [`module.yaml`](../plugin/chatbot/module.yaml))
- User-edited `skills/humanizer/SKILL.md` always wins; built-in default auto-seeded on first access
- `SkillStore` modeled 1:1 on `MemoryStore` — no general skills framework yet

**Future (Hermes-style, not implemented):** `skills_list`, `skill_view`, `skill_manage` with progressive disclosure (list overview → view full skill → create/edit/patch/delete). No `SKILLS_GUIDANCE` constant exists in code today.

### WriterAgent vs Hermes

| Aspect | Hermes (upstream) | WriterAgent |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Memory injection | Frozen snapshot, both files | Live read of `USER.md` each prompt build (no frozen snapshot yet) |
| Memory tool | `memory` add/replace/remove/read | `upsert_memory` JSON key/value into `USER.md` |
| Background reviewer | Yes | No |
| Skills injection | Skills index in prompt | Humanizer only (toggle) |
| General skills tools | Full CRUD | Not yet |
| Memory hardening | Snapshot, scanner, drift guard | Flat files only |

### Integration status

| Piece | State |
|-------|--------|
| `upsert_memory` + memory `auto_discover` | Active |
| `USER.md` prompt injection | Active |
| Humanizer prompt injection | Active |
| Frozen snapshot / threat scan / drift guard | Not implemented |
| Background reviewer | Not implemented |
| General skills list/view/manage | Not implemented |
| Tests | [`tests/chatbot/test_memory.py`](../tests/chatbot/test_memory.py), [`tests/chatbot/test_skills.py`](../tests/chatbot/test_skills.py) |

### Prompt layer notes

- `get_chat_system_prompt_for_document` selects Writer, Calc, or Draw bases. Memory guidance and injection apply on the **Writer** path (and librarian onboarding).
- `TOOL_USAGE_PATTERNS` (separate from memory/skills) documents document-tool conventions in the same Writer prompt bundle.
- Commented todo guidance below `DEFAULT_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` describes Hermes-style planning with a `todo` tool — not in the live prompt unless enabled.

## Hermes integration landscape

WriterAgent already mirrors several Hermes concepts:

- **ACP backend** — Chat with Document can use `hermes acp` (or other ACP agents) instead of built-in `LlmClient` ([`acp_backend.py`](../plugin/agent_backend/acp_backend.py), [`hermes_simple.py`](../plugin/agent_backend/hermes_simple.py)).
- **Todo / planning** — Adaptation of Hermes `todo_tool.py` ([`todo.py`](../plugin/chatbot/todo.py), [`todo_store.py`](../plugin/contrib/todo_store.py)).
- **Parsers & robustness** — Hermes-format `<tool_call>` parser, `safe_json_loads` repair.
- **Bidirectional bridges** — User skills in `~/.hermes/skills/` (`writeragent-extension-layers`, `libreoffice-mcp`) document architecture and call WriterAgent via MCP.
- **Sandbox** — Vendored AST sandbox + warm venv worker with trusted `plugin/scripting/*` stubs (tailored to LO + numpy/pandas/scipy + vision vs. Hermes’s own execution environments).

---

## Skills catalog and priorities

Hermes now ships a large bundled library plus `optional-skills/` and hub installs (hundreds of `SKILL.md` files). Most are service glue (Notion, email, GitHub, calendar) or coding-agent workflow. WriterAgent already covers file open/import (LibreOffice), vision/OCR, web research, librarian, grammar, and HTML-in-Writer — so **do not port file parsers**.

Port the same way as humanizer: trim to a short office-tuned guidance block, ambient injection + Settings checkbox, user `SKILL.md` wins. Do not copy Hermes `terminal` / helper-script machinery unless a later skill truly needs it (`youtube-content`).

### Seed next (same shape as humanizer)

| Skill | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `creative/humanizer` | **Shipped** | AI-slop removal + human voice. See § WriterAgent implementation. |
| `productivity/document-to-action-items` + `productivity/meeting-action-items` | **Next (merge into one)** | One WriterAgent skill. Split decisions / proposals / commitments / risks; keep may–should–must; never invent owner or due date (`unresolved`); every item cites a heading/paragraph; draft only — no tracker writes unless asked. LibreOffice does not do this. Output: Writer table or Calc sheet. Fits the legal/professional pitch in [`business-freemium.md`](business-freemium.md). |
| `research/grounded-citations` | **Next** | Procedure only — not `scripts/sources.py` and not a bibliography UNO module (still a gap in [`../writer/specialized-toolsets.md`](../writer/specialized-toolsets.md)). Cite-while-drafting; never invent `[n]` or URLs; model-knowledge claims get `[unverified]`; keep conflicting sources; append a mechanical Sources list. Web research already collects URLs; this is the missing craft layer. |
| `optional-skills/communication/one-three-one-rule` | Cheap third | Tiny. “Give me options” → 1 problem, 3 distinct options, 1 recommendation + definition of done. Zero deps. Good for memos / strategy docs. |

### Later / optional (not defaults)

| Skill | Why keep on the shelf |
|-------|------------------------|
| `media/youtube-content` | Transcript → chapters / summary / blog in Writer. Real request. Needs `youtube-transcript-api` in the venv — not prompt-only. |
| `creative/architecture-diagram` | Self-contained HTML+SVG; maps to existing HTML import. Heavy template, not ambient. |
| `creative/baoyu-infographic` | Layout × style catalog on top of existing image gen. Lots of reference files. |
| `research/arxiv` | Still the lightest research helper (stdlib / curl). Niche unless people write papers in Writer. |

### Dropped from the old shortlist

| Former candidate | Why it left the seed list |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| `software-development/plan` | Coding-agent TDD/plan-mode, not an office skill. Contributor plan+todo discipline stays under **Other patterns** below — do not seed it for end users. |
| `productivity/ocr-and-documents` | Overlaps LibreOffice file open + the existing vision/OCR stack. Do not add another engine. |
| `research/llm-wiki` | Project already has `wiki/` + embeddings/FTS. Do not seed a second KB for users. |

**Skip for defaults:** `pdf` / `docx` / `xlsx` / `powerpoint` / `nano-pdf`, `session-librarian` (we have librarian), `weekly-review-planning` / `email-inbox-triage` / Google Workspace (need connectors we do not have), full `research-paper-writing`, `popular-web-designs` / `claude-design` (huge; local pretty-HTML skills already cover taste), service glue, desktop-automation with no LO mapping.

**Recommendation when someone next picks this up:** seed **action-items** and **grounded-citations** next to `memories/` (humanizer is done). Add **one-three-one** only if a third cheap checkbox is wanted. Trim Hermes files the way humanizer was trimmed — office language, no `read_file`/`terminal`, no tracker writes.

---

## Other patterns to evaluate

- **ACP provenance** — Consume `_meta.hermes.sessionProvenance` in the ACP client path (compression depth, rotation reason). Align stderr-only logging and probe handling with `acp_adapter/entry.py`.
- **Plan + todo discipline** — “Plan before you act”; structured state that survives compression.
- **Memory hardening** — Snapshot + threat scan + drift detection (high blast radius when memory is injected).
- **Background reviewer** — Prototype via existing `SmolAgentExecutor` / sub-agent infra after main reply.

---

## Integration principles

- **Reuse first** — Prompt injection points, smol sub-agents, trusted venv modules (`plugin/scripting/`).
- **Shared layout** — `SKILL.md` + directory convention for cross-agent portability (Hermes, WriterAgent, Memento — see [`memento-skills.md`](memento-skills.md)).
- **Vendoring / adaptation** — Small focused pieces (humanizer patterns, action-item / citation procedures, threat scanner) rather than whole subsystems.
- **Injection vs. tools** — Ambient injection for memory and key skills; tools primarily for mutation.
- **Defaults vs. optional** — Tiny high-signal default set; hub/discovery for the rest.
- **Testing & docs** — Matching `tests/chatbot/test_*.py`; update this doc when behavior changes; `make test` before release.

### Prioritized summary

**Skills to seed (when picked up — not scheduled):**

- humanizer (**done**)
- Merged action-items skill (`document-to-action-items` + `meeting-action-items`)
- Grounded-citations procedure (no ledger script)
- Optional cheap third: `one-three-one-rule`

**Infra patterns still worth evaluating (unrelated to the seed list):**

- Memory snapshot + threat scan + drift detection
- ACP provenance consumption
- Background reviewer
- Deeper skills index injection in system prompts
- Bidirectional skill/MCP bridging (already working)
- Plan + todo discipline for *contributor* / coding-agent sessions (not an end-user default)

**Probably skip:**

- File parsers and a second OCR stack
- Full research-paper-writing pipeline; seeding `llm-wiki` for users
- Most service-specific skills; weekly-review / inbox triage without connectors
- Re-implementing Hermes hub/health/watchdog machinery

---

## Open questions

- Which 2–3 skills to seed next after humanizer? **Answered 2026-08:** action-items (merged) + grounded-citations; optional 1-3-1. See § Skills catalog.
- Prototype memory snapshot + scanner — measure prompt size / UX impact?
- Dedicated “use this skill” tool surface vs. prompt-injected procedures only?
- Skill versioning when users have local `SKILL.md` customizations?
- Patterns from Hermes `environments/` or `code_execution_tool` that improve the venv worker without duplicating trusted-module + import policy?
