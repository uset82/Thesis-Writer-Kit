## Proposed Consolidations

### 1. [outline.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/outline.py) + [tree.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/tree.py) → **[outline.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/outline.py)** (high overlap)

Both deal with heading/outline navigation. The overlap is significant:

| outline.py | tree.py | Overlap |
|---|---|---|
| `get_document_outline` | `get_document_tree` | Both build the heading tree — `get_document_tree` is the richer version with bookmarks and content strategies |
| `get_heading_content` | `nav_heading_children` | Both drill into heading content — `nav_heading_children` is richer with locator support |

**Proposal:** Merge into [outline.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/outline.py). Keep `get_document_tree` and `nav_heading_children` as the canonical tools. `get_document_outline` can become a thin wrapper or be absorbed into `get_document_tree` with a [format](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/format.py#30-43) parameter. `get_heading_content` can be absorbed into `nav_heading_children`.

**Savings:** ~2 tool classes eliminated, 1 file removed (~94 lines)

---

### 2. [search.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py) overlaps with [content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py)'s [FindText](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py#262-308)

- `content.py::FindText` — finds text, returns `{start, end, text}` positions
- `search.py::SearchInDocument` — finds text, returns paragraph context
- Both use pattern matching on document text

**Proposal:** Merge [FindText](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py#262-308) into [SearchInDocument](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py#10-140) by adding a `return_offsets` parameter. The caller chooses whether they want character offsets or paragraph context. Remove [FindText](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py#262-308) from [content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py).

**Savings:** ~1 tool class eliminated, ~45 lines

---

### 3. [images.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/images.py) + [images_doc.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/images_doc.py) → **[images.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/images.py)** (split is artificial)

Currently split into:
- [images.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/images.py) — AI-powered image generation/editing (2 tools)
- [images_doc.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/images_doc.py) — Document image management (7 tools)

**Proposal:** Merge into a single [images.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/images.py). The AI generation tools are just 2 small classes that work directly with images. There's no good reason for the split.

**Savings:** 1 file removed, ~20 lines of imports/boilerplate

---

### 4. [bookmarks.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/bookmarks.py) → fold into [structural.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/structural.py)

[bookmarks.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/bookmarks.py) has 2 small tools (51 lines):
- [BookmarkList](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/bookmarks.py#6-34) — lists bookmarks
- [BookmarkCleanup](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/bookmarks.py#36-51) — removes `_mcp_*` bookmarks

[structural.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/structural.py) already has [BookmarkResolve](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/structural.py#254-336). All three are bookmark operations.

**Proposal:** Move [BookmarkList](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/bookmarks.py#6-34) and [BookmarkCleanup](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/bookmarks.py#36-51) into [structural.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/structural.py) (renaming it or keeping the name). Delete [bookmarks.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/bookmarks.py).

**Savings:** 1 file removed, ~10 lines of boilerplate

---

### 5. ~~MCP-AI paragraph summaries~~ (removed, do not merge)

WriterAgent does not ship a separate `annotations.py`. The optional MCP-AI annotation tools (`add_ai_summary`, `get_ai_summaries`, `remove_ai_summary`) and the `ai_summary_first` heading-tree content strategy were **removed**; outline navigation uses `get_document_tree` / `nav_heading_children` with `content_strategy` in `heading_only`, `first_lines`, or `full` only. Implementation: [`plugin/writer/outline.py`](../../plugin/writer/outline.py), [`plugin/writer/tree.py`](../../plugin/writer/tree.py), [`plugin/writer/comments.py`](../../plugin/writer/comments.py).

---

### 6. [stats.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/stats.py) → fold into [content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py)

[stats.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/stats.py) has a single tool, [GetDocumentStats](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/stats.py#10-74) (83 lines). It reads character/word/paragraph/page/heading counts — all document content metadata.

**Proposal:** Move [GetDocumentStats](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/stats.py#10-74) into [content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py). Delete [stats.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/stats.py).

**Savings:** 1 file removed, ~10 lines of boilerplate

---

### 7. ~~Accept/Reject track-change tools → `manage_tracked_changes`~~ (done)

Implemented as `ManageTrackedChanges` in [tracking.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/tracking.py) with
`action` = `accept` / `reject` / `accept_all` / `reject_all` (optional `index` for single).

---

### 8. [fulltext.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/fulltext.py) → fold into [search.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py)

[fulltext.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/fulltext.py) provides [SearchFulltext](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/fulltext.py#6-106) and [GetIndexStats](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/fulltext.py#146-160), both search-related. Combined with [search.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py) (which already has [SearchInDocument](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py#10-140) and [ReplaceInDocument](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py#157-241)), this makes a single coherent "search" module.

**Proposal:** Merge [fulltext.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/fulltext.py) into [search.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py). Delete [fulltext.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/fulltext.py).

**Savings:** 1 file removed, ~10 lines of boilerplate

## Summary of Results

| Consolidation | Files Removed | Tools Reduced | Lines Saved (est.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| outline + tree → outline | 1 | 2 | ~100 |
| FindText → SearchInDocument | 0 | 1 | ~45 |
| images + images_doc → images | 1 | 0 | ~20 |
| bookmarks → structural | 1 | 0 | ~10 |
| stats → content | 1 | 0 | ~10 |
| Accept/Reject → single tool | 0 | 1 | ~25 |
| fulltext → search | 1 | 0 | ~10 |
| **Totals** | **5 files** | **4 tools** | **~220 lines** |

**After consolidation:** counts in the table above are planning estimates only. MCP-AI summary tooling is not part of the codebase.

> [!NOTE]
> The big content files ([content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py) at 1032 lines, [comments.py](../../plugin/writer/comments.py) at 548 lines, [images_doc.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/images_doc.py) at 729 lines) are already large. The proposed merges keep them from getting unwieldy — the largest merge adds ~160 lines to [search.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/search.py) for fulltext.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The format.py and html_import.py helper modules are not tool files and should remain as-is. They provide shared utilities used across multiple tool files.

## Not Recommended

These were considered but rejected:

- **Merging [frames.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/frames.py) into [content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py)** — [content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py) is already 1032 lines; frames are a distinct enough concept
- **Merging [tables.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/tables.py) into [content.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/content.py)** — same size concern; tables have unique cell-addressing semantics  
- **Merging [navigation.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/navigation.py) into [outline.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/outline.py)** — navigation uses ProximityService while outline uses TreeService/DocumentService; different abstractions
- **Merging [tracking.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/tracking.py) into [comments.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/writeragent/plugin/writer/comments.py)** — tracked changes vs comments are different UNO subsystems despite both being "review" intent
