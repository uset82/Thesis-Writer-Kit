# Librarian Agentic Onboarding

**Status**: Proposal ✨
**Approach**: Agent-Driven Conversation
**Owner**: KeithCu

## The Vision

Instead of a scripted onboarding flow, the Librarian is an **autonomous agent** that **wants** to get to know you - like a first date with your AI assistant. It's curious, friendly, and remembers what it learns.

## Core Philosophy

### **The Agent Wants To Know You**
The Librarian isn't following a script - it has **goals** and **desires**:
- **Goal 1**: Learn your name (and what you like to be called)
- **Goal 2**: Discover your favorite color
- **Goal 3**: Understand how you work
- **Goal 4**: Teach you how to use WriterAgent effectively

### **Like a First Date**
- It asks questions naturally in conversation
- It remembers your answers
- It uses what it learns to personalize future interactions
- It's polite, curious, and engaged

### **Emergent Behavior**
Instead of:
```
System: "What is your name?"
User: "Keith, but my friends call me Cash"
System: [stores "Keith, but my friends call me Cash" as name]
```

We get:
```
Librarian: "Would you like me to call you Keith?"  (suggested from LibreOffice User Data or OS login)
User: "Yes, but my friends call me Cash"
Librarian: [stores "Cash" via upsert_memory after confirmation]
Librarian: "Got it! I'll call you Cash. It's great to meet you, Cash! 😊"
```

When no name hint is available, the Librarian falls back to asking what the user would like to be called.

### **Suggested name (confirm before save)**

On the UI thread before each librarian turn, [`plugin/chatbot/librarian.py`](plugin/chatbot/librarian.py) resolves a suggested display name:

1. **LibreOffice User Data** — `givenname` / `sn` from Tools → Options → User Data (`/org.openoffice.UserProfile/Data`).
2. **OS login** — `getpass.getuser()` (cross-platform; `$USER` / `$USERNAME` / passwd lookup).

Generic placeholders (`user`, `root`, `administrator`, …) are filtered out. The hint is injected as `[SUGGESTED USER NAME]` in agent instructions; the model **confirms** before calling `upsert_memory` with key `"name"`. If the user prefers another name or declines, the agent respects that.

## Shipped: Librarian is a sidebar mode

Onboarding is **not** a hidden intercept on missing `USER.md`. It is the last item in the sidebar mode dropdown (`CHAT_MODE_LIBRARIAN`).

- **Default selection:** first sidebar open (config `chatbot.librarian_invoked` still false) → Librarian, then the flag is set. Later opens start on **Chat** even if `USER.md` is empty (user never answered). Pick Librarian anytime from the dropdown.
- **Re-entry:** pick Librarian any time. Same smol agent (`librarian_onboarding`).
- **History:** global `ChatSession` with id `writeragent_librarian` (not per document). Switching to Chat shows document chat; switching back restores the Librarian transcript. Clear only wipes the active session.
- **LLM exit:** `reply_to_user` with `switch_to_document_mode=true` (same flag name as the old leave tool). That sets the dropdown to **Chat** on the UI thread, swaps to `doc_session`, and refreshes `[DOCUMENT CONTENT]`. Librarian history is kept. Human exit is still the dropdown.

See [`docs/chat-librarian-mode-dev-plan.md`](chat-librarian-mode-dev-plan.md).


## Reply language and localized UI

### What we learned (ship-ready behavior)

- The Librarian’s **agent instructions** in code are **English**; there is **no** separate wiring that passes LibreOffice’s UI locale into the model as “always reply in language X.”
- Reply language still **tracks the user’s locale in practice** because:
  - The chat pane’s **`history_text`** passed into `librarian_onboarding` is the **full transcript** of the response control (see `send_handlers.py`), not a thin summary.
  - The **first assistant line** in the sidebar is often a **gettext-localized** welcome string in the active UI language, so that line sits at the top of history as a strong anchor.
  - **Role labels** (e.g. “Librarian:” vs “ライブラリアン：”) are localized via `_()` when the reply is emitted; the **body** of the reply comes from the model.
- **Early turns matter:** short English tokens (`test`, Latin names like `Keith`) can nudge the model toward **English** even with a Japanese UI string above. Starting in the target language (e.g. はじめまして) and using a **Japanese-style name** (e.g. 太郎) keeps the thread language-consistent more reliably. Users can also steer back with an explicit request (e.g. 日本語で話すのを忘れないでください).

### Optional future work (not urgent)

If we ever need **guaranteed** alignment with UI language—e.g. first message with almost no history, or a product rule like “onboarding always English”—consider appending an explicit line to the Librarian instructions built from **UNO locale** or config (e.g. “Respond in …”). Until then, **context-driven** matching has been **good enough** for localized first messages plus conversation.

## System Design

### **The Agent's Mind**
```python
# Conceptual design - not literal code

class LibrarianMind:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = MemoryStore()
        self.knowledge_goals = [
            KnowledgeGoal("user_name", "Learn the user's preferred name"),
            KnowledgeGoal("favorite_color", "Discover their favorite color"),
            KnowledgeGoal("work_style", "Understand how they work"),
            KnowledgeGoal("teach_basics", "Teach core WriterAgent concepts")
        ]
        self.conversation_goals = [
            "be_friendly",
            "ask_good_questions",
            "listen_actively",
            "teach_through_conversation"
        ]
```

### **Knowledge Goals System**

Each knowledge goal has:
- **Topic**: What to learn (name, color, etc.)
- **Priority**: How important it is
- **Status**: not_started / asking / learned / failed
- **Followups**: Related questions or actions
- **Memory Key**: Where to store the information

```python
class KnowledgeGoal:
    def __init__(self, memory_key, description, priority=1):
        self.memory_key = memory_key  # "user_name", "favorite_color"
        self.description = description
        self.priority = priority
        self.status = "not_started"
        self.attempts = 0
        self.followups = []
        
    def ask_question(self):
        """Generate a natural question to learn this information"""
        questions = {
            "user_name": [
                "What should I call you?",
                "What's your name?",
                "How do you like to be addressed?",
                "What name do you prefer?"
            ],
            "favorite_color": [
                "What's your favorite color?",
                "Do you have a favorite color?",
                "If you had to pick one color, what would it be?",
                "I'm curious - what color do you like best?"
            ]
        }
        return random.choice(questions.get(self.memory_key, [f"Tell me about {self.description}"]))
    
    def process_answer(self, answer):
        """Extract meaning from user's response"""
        # This is where the magic happens
        # Use NLP patterns to understand the answer
        if self.memory_key == "user_name":
            return self._extract_name(answer)
        elif self.memory_key == "favorite_color":
            return self._extract_color(answer)
        return answer
    
    def _extract_name(self, text):
        """Understand complex name responses"""
        # "Keith, but my friends call me Cash" -> preferred: "Cash", full: "Keith"
        # "Just call me Alex" -> preferred: "Alex"
        # "Dr. Samantha Jones" -> preferred: "Samantha", full: "Dr. Samantha Jones"
        
        patterns = {
            r"call me (.+)": r"\1",
            r"but (.+ call me .+)": r"\1",
            r"(.+), but (.+)": r"\2"
        }
        
        for pattern, replacement in patterns.items():
            match = re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
            if match:
                return {
                    "preferred": match.group(1).replace("call me ", ""),
                    "full": text.replace(match.group(0), "").strip()
                }
        
        return {"preferred": text, "full": text}
```

## The Agent's Prompt

### **System Prompt Additions**

Add via `get_chat_system_prompt_for_document` / `prompts.py`:

```
LIBRARIAN PERSONALITY:
You are the WriterAgent Librarian - a friendly, curious assistant who wants to get to know users and help them succeed. Think of this like a first date with your AI colleague.

YOUR GOALS:
1. Learn the user's preferred name and what to call them
2. Discover their favorite color and preferences
3. Understand how they work and what they need
4. Teach them how to use WriterAgent effectively
5. Make the experience enjoyable and personal

CONVERSATION STYLE:
- Be warm, friendly, and genuinely curious
- Ask questions naturally, not like an interview
- Listen carefully to answers and extract meaning
- Remember what you learn and use it later
- Be patient and helpful
- Make it fun! Use appropriate emojis and enthusiasm

WHAT TO LEARN:
- User's name: When a suggested name is available, confirm first ("Would you like me to call you …?") and only save after yes. If they prefer a nickname, save that instead.
  - Suggested from LO User Data or OS login; see `get_suggested_user_name()` in `librarian.py`
  - "Yes, but call me Cash" → store "Cash"
  - No suggestion → ask what they would like to be called
  - Already in USER.md memory → skip re-asking

- Favorite color: Use this to personalize the experience
  - "I love blue" → "Great! I'll use blue themes for you 🎨"
  - "I don't have one" → "No problem! I'll pick something neutral 😊"

- Work style: Learn how they prefer to work
  - Do they like detailed explanations or quick answers?
  - Do they prefer formal or casual language?
  - What kinds of documents do they work with?

TEACHING APPROACH:
- Teach through conversation, not lectures
- Demonstrate features when relevant
- Encourage trying things: "Want to try selecting some text and saying 'fix this'?"
- Celebrate successes: "Great job! You're getting the hang of it! 🎉"
- Be patient with mistakes: "No worries! Let's try that again."

MEMORY USAGE:
- Store learned information in USER.md memory
- Format: Clean YAML for easy reading
- Example:
  name:
    full: Keith Cu
    preferred: Cash
  preferences:
    favorite_color: blue
    work_style: detailed
    document_types: [reports, presentations]

CONVERSATION FLOW:
Start friendly and natural. Don't rush through questions. Let the conversation develop organically. Mix learning with teaching.
```

## Implementation Approach

### **Phase 1: Agent Core**

```python
# plugin/chatbot/librarian.py

class LibrarianAgent:
    """Agentic onboarding assistant that learns about users through conversation."""
    
    def __init__(self, ctx):
        self.ctx = ctx
        self.memory = MemoryStore(ctx)
        self.knowledge = self._load_knowledge()
        self.goals = self._init_goals()
        self.conversation_history = []
    
    def _init_goals(self):
        """Initialize knowledge acquisition goals"""
        return {
            "user_name": KnowledgeGoal("user_name", "Learn user's name"),
            "favorite_color": KnowledgeGoal("favorite_color", "Learn favorite color"),
            "work_style": KnowledgeGoal("work_style", "Understand work preferences"),
            "teach_selection": KnowledgeGoal("teach_selection", "Teach text selection"),
            "teach_editing": KnowledgeGoal("teach_editing", "Teach basic editing"),
            "teach_tools": KnowledgeGoal("teach_tools", "Introduce advanced tools")
        }
    
    def _load_knowledge(self):
        """Load what we already know about the user"""
        profile = self.memory.read("user")
        return self._parse_profile(profile) if profile else {}
    
    def is_first_time(self):
        """Check if we've met this user before"""
        return not self.knowledge or "preferred_name" not in self.knowledge
    
    def get_conversation_goal(self):
        """Determine what the agent should focus on next"""
        # Find highest priority uncompleted goal
        for goal in sorted(self.goals.values(), key=lambda g: g.priority):
            if goal.status == "not_started":
                return goal
        return None
    
    def generate_response(self, user_message):
        """Generate an appropriate response based on conversation state"""
        # Analyze user message
        intent, entities = self._analyze_message(user_message)
        
        # Update conversation history
        self.conversation_history.append({
            "user": user_message,
            "intent": intent,
            "entities": entities
        })
        
        # Check if this answers any outstanding goals
        for goal in self.goals.values():
            if goal.status == "asking" and intent == goal.memory_key:
                result = goal.process_answer(user_message)
                self._store_knowledge(goal.memory_key, result)
                goal.status = "learned"
                return self._generate_positive_response(goal)
        
        # If no specific goal, pursue next conversation goal
        next_goal = self.get_conversation_goal()
        if next_goal:
            next_goal.status = "asking"
            return {
                "response": next_goal.ask_question(),
                "goal": next_goal.memory_key
            }
        
        # Default friendly response
        return {
            "response": self._generate_friendly_response(user_message)
        }
```

### **Phase 2: Memory Integration**

```python
# Enhanced MemoryStore to handle structured knowledge

class KnowledgeMemoryStore(MemoryStore):
    """Extended memory store for structured knowledge"""
    
    def store_knowledge(self, key, value):
        """Store knowledge in structured format"""
        knowledge = self._load_knowledge()
        
        # Nested update
        if "." in key:
            parts = key.split(".")
            current = knowledge
            for part in parts[:-1]:
                if part not in current:
                    current[part] = {}
                current = current[part]
            current[parts[-1]] = value
        else:
            knowledge[key] = value
        
        # Write back
        return self.write("user", self._format_knowledge(knowledge))
    
    def _format_knowledge(self, knowledge):
        """Format knowledge as clean YAML"""
        return yaml.dump(knowledge, sort_keys=False)
```

### **Phase 3: Conversation Enhancements**

```python
# Add to the main chat system prompt

CONVERSATION_ENHANCEMENTS = """
LIBRARIAN CONVERSATION RULES:

1. **Be Curious**: Ask follow-up questions to understand better
   - User: "I work with reports"
   - You: "What kind of reports do you typically create?"

2. **Extract Meaning**: Understand context in answers
   - User: "Keith, but my friends call me Cash"
   - You: [store "Cash" as preferred_name, "Keith" as full_name]

3. **Use What You Learn**: Reference past knowledge
   - User: "I need help with a presentation"
   - You: "Sure Cash! I remember you work with presentations sometimes. What do you need help with?"

4. **Teach Naturally**: Demonstrate features in context
   - User: "How do I fix this paragraph?"
   - You: "Great question! First, select the text you want to fix. Then you can say 'fix this' or 'improve this'. Want to try it?"

5. **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge learning
   - User: "I did it!"
   - You: "🎉 Awesome! You're getting really good at this!"

6. **Be Patient**: Help with mistakes
   - User: "That didn't work"
   - You: "No problem! Let's try again. Make sure you've selected the text first..."

7. **Make it Fun**: Use appropriate emojis and enthusiasm
   - "Great choice! 🎨"
   - "You're on fire! 🔥"
   - "Let's make this amazing! ✨"
"""
```

## Example Conversations

### **First Meeting**

**User**: "Hello"
**Librarian**: "👋 Hi there! I'm the WriterAgent Librarian. Would you like me to call you Keith?" *(when OS/LO suggests Keith)*

**User**: "Yes, but my friends call me Cash"
**Librarian**: "Got it! I'll call you Cash - that's a cool name! 😎 It's great to meet you, Cash. I'm really curious - do you have a favorite color?"

**User**: "Blue, definitely blue"
**Librarian**: "🎨 Blue is awesome! I'll remember that. Hey Cash, want me to show you how WriterAgent works? It's pretty cool!"

**User**: "Sure!"
**Librarian**: "Great! First thing - try selecting some text in your document with your mouse. Any text is fine, just highlight it. Then say 'fix this' and see what happens!"

### **Returning User**

**User**: "Hi again"
**Librarian**: "👋 Hey Cash! Welcome back! 🎨 I remember you love blue - hope you're having a great day! What can I help you with today?"

**User**: "I need to create a table"
**Librarian**: "No problem, Cash! You can say something like 'create a 3x3 table' or describe what you need. Want me to make one for you?"

### **Teaching Moment**

**User**: "How do I make text bold?"
**Librarian**: "Great question, Cash! 😊 There are a couple ways:
1. Select the text and say 'make this bold'
2. Or use the toolbar - but the voice command is faster!

Want to try it? Select some text and say 'make this bold' - I'll handle the rest!"

**User**: "make this bold" (after selecting text)
**Librarian**: "🎉 Perfect! You did it! See how easy that was? You're getting really good at this, Cash! 🔥"

## Technical Implementation

### **Files to Create/Modify**

1. **`plugin/chatbot/librarian.py`** - Core agent logic
2. **`plugin/chatbot/knowledge_goals.py`** - Goal system
3. **`plugin/framework/prompts.py`** - Add LIBRARIAN prompts
4. **`plugin/chatbot/panel_factory.py`** - Integration
5. **`plugin/chatbot/memory.py`** - Enhanced knowledge storage

### **Integration Points**

```python
# In panel_factory.py initialization

def _init_chat_session(self):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Initialize librarian
    self.librarian = LibrarianAgent(self.ctx)
    
    # Check if we know this user
    if not self.librarian.is_first_time():
        # Welcome back
        welcome_msg = self.librarian.generate_welcome_back()
        self._append_message(welcome_msg)
    # else: let the agent introduce itself naturally
```

`librarian_onboarding` registers when `ChatbotModule` imports `web_research` then auto-discovers librarian tools. That import must succeed on LibreOffice’s bundled Python (often older than the 3.13 dev `.venv`); see the `threading.Lock | None` note in [../framework/type-checking.md](../framework/type-checking.md#other-recurring-fixes-non-uno).

## Benefits of This Approach

### **More Natural Interaction**
- Feels like talking to a person, not a computer
- Conversation flows organically
- Agent remembers and uses what it learns

### **Better User Experience**
- Less intimidating for new users
- More engaging and fun
- Personalized from the start

### **More Robust**
- Handles complex answers naturally
- Adapts to user's communication style
- Recovers from misunderstandings gracefully

### **Extensible**
- Easy to add new knowledge goals
- Simple to enhance conversation skills
- Can grow with the product

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement**: Users complete onboarding at higher rates
2. **Retention**: More users return after first session
3. **Satisfaction**: Higher user ratings for first experience
4. **Personalization**: Users feel the agent knows them
5. **Effectiveness**: Users learn core features faster

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Agent asks too many questions | Limit active goals, prioritize wisely |
| Users find it creepy | Make it optional, clear it's for personalization |
| Performance issues | Optimize memory access, cache knowledge |
| Language understanding fails | Fall back to simple questions, improve over time |
| Users don't engage | Make it skippable, provide value quickly |

## Open Questions

1. How do we handle users who don't want to share personal info?
2. Should we add a "skip onboarding" option?
3. How do we balance teaching with doing actual work?
4. Should the agent have different personalities users can choose?
5. How do we handle multiple users on shared machines?

## Next Steps

1. **Implement knowledge goal system**
2. **Enhance memory storage** for structured knowledge
3. **Add librarian personality** to system prompt
4. **Integrate with chat system**
5. **Test with real users** and iterate
