# Agent Search: Autonomous Sub-Agent Web Searching

This document outlines the architecture and implementation of the **web search** capabilities in WriterAgent. The goal has been to provide the main AI agent with a robust tool to search the internet, navigate pages, and return a synthesized answer, all while keeping external dependencies to a minimum. 

---

## 1. Purpose and Architecture

- **Purpose**: Add a `search_web` tool to the main WriterAgent agent allowing it to perform autonomous web research.
- **Sub-Agent Approach**: Instead of having the main agent issue individual search queries and fetch URLs—which consumes significant context and risks derailing the main task—the `search_web` tool delegates the entire research task to an autonomous **sub-agent**.
- **Smolagents**: We have **vendored** parts of the Hugging Face `smolagents` library (specifically the `ToolCallingAgent` and supporting models/tools) to power this sub-agent. The sub-agent runs its own ReAct loop to iteratively search, read, and synthesize information until it finds the answer.

---

## 2. Implementation Details

### Vendoring Smolagents
To avoid introducing a heavy external dependency on `smolagents` (which ordinarily pulls in `requests`, `transformers`, `huggingface_hub`, etc.), we vendored only the core modules (`agents.py`, `models.py`, `tools.py`, `default_tools.py`, etc.) into `plugin/contrib/smolagents/`.
- We removed all HF/Gradio specific code.
- We modified `agents.py` to load its prompts from a bundled Python module (`toolcalling_agent_prompts.py`) rather than depending on `pyyaml`.

### Zero-Dependency Web Tools
The original `smolagents` web tools (`DuckDuckGoSearchTool` and `VisitWebpageTool`) rely on `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `markdownify`. We completely rewrote these tools to use only Python's standard library:
- **Networking**: Replaced `requests` with `urllib.request`. Both tools send a realistic Firefox user agent string (`Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:148.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/148.0`) to reduce 403s from some sites (e.g., Yelp).
- **Parsing**: Replaced `beautifulsoup4` and `markdownify` with custom subclasses of standard `html.parser.HTMLParser` to extract search results and strip tags for page content reading.

### LlmClient Wrapper
To ensure the sub-agent uses the exact same model, endpoint, and API keys as the rest of WriterAgent, we created `WriterAgentSmolModel` (in [`plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py)). This class extends the `smolagents` base `Model` class but overrides `generate()` to proxy all requests directly to WriterAgent's existing `LlmClient`. For CLI testing without LibreOffice we also provide `OpenRouterSmolModel` in `scripts/test_search_web.py`, which talks directly to OpenRouter’s OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.

### The `web_research` Tool
Exposed in [`plugin/chatbot/web_research.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/web_research.py) (also reachable via specialized delegate `domain=web_research`), the tool accepts a research `query` and optional history. When invoked:
1. It builds a `WriterAgentSmolModel` via [`plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py).
2. It initializes a `ToolCallingAgent` equipped with the zero-dependency DuckDuckGo and Webpage Visitor tools.
3. It kicks off the `smolagents` run loop, which autonomously researches the query until it calls the `final_answer` tool or hits a timeout/max-steps limit.
4. It catches the final answer and returns it to the main agent as JSON: `{"status": "ok", "result": "<answer>"}` (or `{"status": "error", "message": "..."}` on failure/timeout).

`web_search` accepts an optional `recency` (`day`/`week`/`month`/`year`/`any`) that maps to DuckDuckGo Lite's `df` time filter. Search-cache keys include that token so filtered hits do not collide with evergreen ones. Today's date is injected by [`LlmClient`](../../plugin/framework/client/llm_client.py), not a second research prompt.

### Prompt for web research (HITL)

When **Prompt for Web Research** is enabled (`chatbot.prompt_for_web_research`), each internal `web_search` step in the sub-agent blocks until the user accepts, edits, or rejects the DuckDuckGo query. This applies in **main chat** (via `web_research` / delegate) and in dedicated **Web Research** sidebar mode.

Before the Accept/Change/Reject wait, the sidebar response area shows a `Tool: web_search` line plus the search-engine preview sentence (`web_research_chat.web_search_engine_step_chat_text`). Reject leaves that line in the transcript; Change appends a second preview for the edited query.

## 3. Vendored Files Overview

To facilitate the sub-agent without burdening WriterAgent with dependencies, we've pulled in a specific subset of the `smolagents` library. Here is an overview of what each file does and its importance to the project:

### Significant Files

**`plugin/contrib/smolagents/agents.py`**
This is the core engine of the sub-agent approach. It contains the `ToolCallingAgent` and `MultiStepAgent` classes which orchestrate the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) loop. These classes are responsible for setting up the system prompts, delegating to the model, parsing the model's desired tool calls, executing those tools in the environment, and feeding the observations back into the loop until a final answer is reached. Modifications here are primarily focused on removing external prompt loading (like `pyyaml`) in favor of bundled Python prompt strings.

**`plugin/contrib/smolagents/tools.py`**
This file defines the base `Tool` class and the infrastructure for exposing Python functions to the LLM. It contains the logic for inspecting function signatures, generating JSON schemas, and securely mapping the LLM's requested arguments to the actual Python execution. It is vital for ensuring the agent can understand what tools are available and how to call them correctly.

**`plugin/contrib/smolagents/default_tools.py`**
This file houses the actual tools that the web search sub-agent relies on to achieve its goals. Most notably, it contains `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` for querying the web and `VisitWebpageTool` for scraping actual page content. We have completely overhauled this file to use only standard Python libraries (`urllib.request` and `html.parser`), eliminating the need for `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, or `markdownify`.

**[`plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py)**
This is the bridge between `smolagents` and WriterAgent's `LlmClient`. It provides `WriterAgentSmolModel` (implements `smolagents.models.Model`), plus `to_smol_inputs` / `SmolToolAdapter` and `build_toolcalling_agent`. This ensures the sub-agent uses the exact same model preferences, API keys, and enterprise endpoints configured by the user.

### Trivial / Supporting Files

- **`plugin/contrib/smolagents/models.py`**: Contains the abstract shapes and data classes (like `ChatMessage` and `ToolCall`) used by `smolagents` to model conversational turns, with all heavy provider-specific integrations stripped out.
- **`plugin/contrib/smolagents/memory.py`**: Manages the conversation history and the agent's internal memory tape (`ActionStep`), keeping track of past tool calls and observations within a single run.
- **`plugin/contrib/smolagents/utils.py`**: Provides various helper functions for string formatting, logging, and previously Jinja2 templating (which is in the process of being removed).
- **`plugin/contrib/smolagents/agent_types.py`**: Defines core data structures and typed dicts used throughout the library to enforce type safety.
- **`plugin/contrib/smolagents/serialization.py`, `_function_type_hints_utils.py`, `tool_validation.py`**: These provide the underlying parsing and validation logic that allows `smolagents` to convert python types into strict JSON schemas for the LLM to consume.
- **`plugin/contrib/smolagents/monitoring.py`**: Contains hooks for logging and tracking agent performance, although much of its external telemetry has been bypassed for our local environment.
- **`plugin/contrib/smolagents/__init__.py`**: Exposes the relevant classes for clean importing, heavily pruned to ignore modules we didn't vendor (e.g., Gradio UI, CLI).

---

## 4. Current Status & Testing

**What is Done:**
- **Vendoring core files**: Copied `agents.py`, `models.py`, `tools.py`, `default_tools.py`, etc. to `plugin/contrib/smolagents`.
- **Tool Adaptation**: Completely rewrote `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` and `VisitWebpageTool` in `default_tools.py` to use `urllib.request` and standard library parsers, with a realistic Firefox user agent to reduce 403s.
- **Model Wrapper**: Built `WriterAgentSmolModel` ([`plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/smol_agent.py)) to connect the sub-agent directly to WriterAgent's existing `LlmClient`.
- **Tool Registration**: Registered the `search_web` / web-research path so the ReAct loop runs via the shared smol agent construction.
- **YAML/Jinja2 removal for ToolCallingAgent**: Replaced `populate_template()` in `ToolCallingAgent.initialize_system_prompt()` with `_render_toolcalling_system_prompt()` and prompts in `toolcalling_agent_prompts.py` using simple placeholders. The search_web path no longer depends on Jinja2.
- **Optional Rich/logging**: `monitoring.py` and `agents.py` use lightweight stubs when `rich` is absent; the search_web path logs to stderr/stdout only, and our `Console` stub ignores Rich-only kwargs like `style=...`.
- **Optional heavy deps (PIL/requests/audio)**: `agent_types.py` treats Pillow and requests as optional; image/audio types only require them if actually used. This keeps the vendored package importable on a minimal Python install while search_web (text only) continues to work.
- **Error handling and timeout**: `tool_search_web` catches all exceptions and returns JSON `{"status": "error", "message": "..."}`; optional config key `search_web_timeout` (default 120 s) wraps the sub-agent in a `ThreadPoolExecutor` so long-running searches do not block the UI indefinitely.
- **CLI harness (OpenRouter)**: `scripts/test_search_web.py` provides a standalone CLI that uses `OpenRouterSmolModel` + `ToolCallingAgent` + `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` + `VisitWebpageTool` against OpenRouter. It defaults to `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b` and falls back to a plain completion if the model does not emit JSON tool-calls.

**Manual Testing Notes:**
- From the repo root:
  - `export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..."`  
  - `python -m scripts.test_search_web "What is the latest stable Python release and when was it released?"`
- You can pass `--model some/other-model` or `--max-tokens 4096` to experiment.
- Models that fully support OpenAI tool-calling will drive the ReAct loop (web_search + visit_webpage + final_answer). Models that ignore tools will still produce a useful answer via the direct-completion fallback.

## 5. Web research report cache (fuzzy matching)

Completed `web_research` / delegate `web_research` reports can be cached in the shared SQLite `web_cache` table (`kind="research"`). Keys are normalized query word lists (fluff stripped, min token length 3). New entries are stored as `{snowball_lang}|{word key}` (e.g. `english|elevator physics space`); legacy unprefixed keys still work.

**Instruction fluff** ([`research_cache_fluff.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/research_cache_fluff.py)): web-research prompt filler words are listed as standard `_('…')` calls in `translated_research_cache_fluff()` — same gettext path as the rest of the extension (`make extract-strings`, `make auto-translate`). At runtime `get_research_fluff_words()` tokenizes those translated strings for the active LO UI locale and unions grammar stop words from [`stop_words.py`](../../plugin/writer/locale/stop_words.py) for the document/Snowball language (generated from [stopwords-iso](https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-iso) via `python scripts/generate_stop_words.py`).

**Lookup order:** exact key (legacy or prefixed) → embedding match among same-language keys when local embeddings are configured and already warm → fuzzy stem match among same-language keys.

**Embedding match:** when the local embeddings venv is configured, WriterAgent opportunistically stores vectors for research cache keys in a companion SQLite table (`web_cache_embeddings`). The web research path does not wait for cold model startup or old-row migration:

- New cache writes enqueue embedding generation in a background worker after the report is saved, using normalized query terms in their original order.
- Old `kind="research"` rows are backfilled in the same background path. Their original prompt order is not recoverable, so backfill uses the stored normalized word key.
- Lookup only attempts embedding search when stored vectors already exist, and uses a short timeout for the query vector. Missing dependencies, unsupported providers, model downloads, or worker errors silently fall back to the old stem/Jaccard path.
- Embedding hits use **Research Cache Embedding Match (%)** (default 75) as their cosine threshold.
- Cosine search runs in LibreOffice Python over JSON vectors stored in SQLite; only embedding generation runs in the user venv.

**Fuzzy match** ([`plugin/chatbot/web_research_cache.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/web_research_cache.py)):

- Stems use the same Snowball algorithms as writer full-text search ([`linguistic_index.py`](../../plugin/writer/locale/linguistic_index.py) `_ISO_TO_SNOWBALL`).
- Language: document `CharLocale` → LibreOffice UI locale → `english`. Both UNO reads are marshalled to the main thread via `execute_on_main_thread` because `web_research` runs on an async worker.
- Similarity = `max(union Jaccard, overlap / min(|A|, |B|))` so repeat prompts with extra words still match.
- Gates: similarity ≥ **Research Cache Fuzzy Match (%)** (default 60) and shared stem count ≥ **Min Stem Overlap** (default 8).

Settings UI: `web_research_cache_enabled` only. Cache matching tuning (`web_research_cache_embedding_percent`, `web_research_cache_jaccard_percent`, `web_research_cache_min_overlap`) is **internal** — defaults from module YAML, override in `writeragent.json` if needed. Sidebar shows `hit_embedding` / `hit_fuzzy` with match percent and stored key.

## 6. Future Considerations

### Deep Research (sidebar mode)

Choose **Deep Research** in the sidebar mode dropdown to run a **breadth/depth multi-query loop** via a dedicated sub-agent that can **`apply_document_content`** after synthesis. The main agent and specialized delegates **always** use shallow web research — they never pass `deep=True`; only the sidebar Deep Research session does.

Shallow **Web Research** sidebar mode streams results to chat only and does not expose document editing tools.

The loop is ported from [gpt-researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher)’s `DeepResearchSkill`. The `gpt-researcher/` subdirectory in this repo is a **reference only** — it is not imported at runtime and is excluded from the OXT bundle (`.gitignore`).

**Flow (adaptive deep mode):**

1. **Plan** — LLM generates follow-up questions from the user query (+ optional DuckDuckGo preview snippet).
2. **Round loop** (up to `chatbot.deep_research_max_rounds`, default 3):
   - **Breadth** — LLM generates N search queries per round (`chatbot.deep_research_breadth`, default 4).
   - **Parallel sub-queries** — up to `chatbot.deep_research_concurrency` shallow ReAct sub-agents run at once (global cap: `chatbot.deep_research_max_sub_queries`, default 14).
   - **Per sub-query** — `_run_web_agent` with research goal, visited-URL dedup, and optional extra step budget.
   - **Extract** — LLM pulls learnings, citations, and source URLs from each sub-report.
   - **Assess** — LLM scores coverage (`chatbot.deep_research_quality_threshold`, default 7/10); stops early when sufficient or continues with gap-filling queries.
3. **Synthesize** — LLM writes one plain-text report (`WEB_RESEARCH_PLAIN_TEXT_FORMAT` in [`web_research.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/web_research.py)) including a sources list. If that last LLM call fails, the orchestrator returns the collected learnings and sources instead of discarding the run. If no learnings were collected, it returns an error payload rather than a “completed” report on empty evidence.

`VisitWebpageTool` does not cache fetch-error strings (a transient 403/timeout must not replay for `web_cache_validity_days`).

Implementation: [`plugin/chatbot/web_research_deep.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/web_research_deep.py) (adaptive orchestrator + JSON parsers); sidebar session [`plugin/chatbot/deep_research_session.py`](../../plugin/chatbot/deep_research_session.py) (`deep_research_web` → `apply_document_content`); shallow agent helper [`_run_web_agent`](../../plugin/chatbot/web_research.py).

**Config (internal, JSON override):** `chatbot.deep_research_breadth`, `chatbot.deep_research_max_rounds`, `chatbot.deep_research_depth` (legacy alias when `max_rounds` is 0), `chatbot.deep_research_concurrency`, `chatbot.deep_research_max_sub_queries`, `chatbot.deep_research_quality_threshold`, `chatbot.deep_research_sub_agent_steps`.

---

While the current implementation uses standard, unauthenticated HTTP requests via DuckDuckGo Lite, there is prior research on handling authenticated sites or executing JavaScript natively. The following sections are kept for future reference if we need to escalate beyond basic unauthenticated HTML scraping.

### A) yt-dlp cookie extraction (reference implementation)
If there is a need to mimic the user's browser via cookies (to avoid blocks/CAPTCHAs):
- **Source**: `yt_dlp/cookies.py` (Unlicense).
- **SQLite**: `sqlite3` is part of stdlib. Cookie values are extracted directly from Firefox (`cookies.sqlite`) or Chrome (`Cookies`).
- **Standard library**: `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` can attach cookies to a `urllib.request.Request`. The request then carries a `Cookie` header for the target URL's domain/path.

### B) Easy way to "make requests + run JS" via Chrome (without Playwright)
If the sub-agent needs to render JS-heavy search result pages, we can avoid heavy dependencies like Playwright (~150MB headless browser):
- **PyCDP** ([py-cdp.readthedocs.io](https://py-cdp.readthedocs.io/)): Thin Python client generated from the CDP spec. Avoids bundling a browser. Connects to a Chrome instance via `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. 
- **Pydoll**: Lightweight, CDP-based, async alternative.

### C) Lightweight option for Firefox
Firefox deprecated CDP in favor of WebDriver BiDi (v129+).
- **Marionette**: Firefox's built-in remote protocol via `-marionette` (port 2828). JSON over TCP. 
- Python clients include `marionette_driver` (Mozilla's maintained client) or the tiny `k0s/marionette_client`.

*Phase 2 roadmap*: Connect to the user's running browser via PyCDP (Chrome) or Marionette (Firefox) when the AI needs to read complex, JS-heavy pages or deeply embedded SPAs. This acts as an opt-in power feature where the user runs a simple launch script.
